"6 years on, the National Assembly has struggled to show its worth","The National Assembly was formed to give experienced people a chance to be part of the parliament and help during the formation of important bills. In countries that follow the Westminster model of government, the upper house plays an important role. That, however, is not the case in Nepal as the country’s upper house has become a platform where individuals secure positions in the National Assembly based on their connections. As the election nears, many once again question the  relevance and existence of the upper house. Things were different in the past as the initial years of the National Assembly saw experienced politicians and experts others in their field be nominated for the post. That slowly changed as the first batch completed its two-year term. “I understand why people are frustrated with the upper house. People expected experts but all we got was party cadres who lacked knowledge or experience,” says Bimala Rai Paudyal a National Assembly member. “Considering such behaviour and practices, what distinguishes the House of Representatives from the National Assembly?” A loser’s second chance  Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who faced defeat in the 2017 general election from Gorkha-2, was elected as a member of the National Assembly on  January 23, 2020 . Elected from Gandaki Province, Shrestha currently is the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country. Bhagwati Neupane who lost the election from Gandaki province and Bimala Ghimire who lost the election for mayorship in Bhanu Municipality also shared the same trajectory. Similarly, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav and Jag Prasad Sharma were defeated in the House of Representatives elections, from Saptari-4 and Dang-3 respectively are now members of the National Assembly. Bam Dev Gautam, who lost the elections from Bardiya, secured a place in the upper house through nomination by President Bidya Devi Bhandari. Even those who did not win as ward member(s) got the opportunity to become members of the National Assembly including Sindh Bahadur Bishwakarma who was appointed on February 7, 2018. He is soon leaving his post on March 3. Despite the repeated criticisms, the political parties have not paid attention to this concern posed by political leaders and the general public. The latest proof of this is the list of candidates for the  National Assembly elections scheduled on Jan uary 25. The list contains names like Krishna Prasad Sitaula, defeated in the House of Representatives elections in 2022 from Koshi Province, and Pooja Chaudhary, who lost in the provincial assembly elections 2022 from Rautahat-3 (a). Speaker Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who led the National Assembly for the entire six years under the federal system, is also dissatisfied with the individuals who have made it to the upper house.  “The allegations are something for the parties to ponder upon. The leaders should have prioritised involving intellectuals/neutrals rather than managing its members,” he says. The 59-member National Assembly elects eight representatives, equally from all seven provinces, with an additional three individuals nominated by the President. The Constitution ensures representation of women, Dalits, minorities or disabled communities, envisioning that experts, experienced individuals, and the most qualified people from various fields will become members of the National Assembly. Easy way in There are some reasons why leaders aspire to join the upper house, and even the leadership create opportunities for them.  In National Assembly elections, voters consist of local-level heads/deputy heads and provincial assembly members. Typically, individuals seeking these positions undergo a vetting process by their respective parties. As a result, aspiring members of parliament can focus less on persuading individual voters and more on gaining party support to secure their candidacy.  Moreover, being a member of the National Assembly opens avenues to ministerial roles. The constitution prohibits a National Assembly member from becoming the Prime Minister, but not Deputy Prime Minister. Due to such opportunities, leaders are enticed to seek a position in the assembly. The National Assembly is currently in its fourth election cycle since the promulgation of the Consitution in 2015. Scheduled for January 25, this election aims to fill 19 seats vacated by individuals completing their six-year terms. The previous election cycles took place in 2017, involving 56 members, followed by 2019 with 18 positions, and 2020 with 19 positions. The cascading impacts Another reason why the National Assembly is finding it difficult to justify itself is that it has become a shadow of the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly did not have one session when the  House of Representatives was dissolved  by then  Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli twice . The demands and issues raised by the opposition parties in the House of Representatives automatically went to the National Assembly, where the parliamentarians of the ruling party put forward any proposal, they endorse it the same as in the House of Representatives. The latest example – is the main opposition UML did not allow the meeting of the House of Representatives to continue for five days from July 5, 2023, due to a statement made by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal during his visit to India. Consequently, the meeting of the National Assembly was also paused during that period. The UML obstructed the House of Representatives for almost a month starting mid-July last year demanding a high-level inquiry committee to probe the  60-kilogram gold smuggling case  and the resignation of the Home Minister. The National Assembly followed suit with leaders pushing their agendas forward. Speaker Ganesh Timilsina himself is dissatisfied that every behaviour and activity of the House of Representatives influence the National Assembly. He says despite his attempts to prevent the overshadowing, it has been unfortunate that he did not garner the goodwill of the top leaders during political disputes. Reinstating power The National Assembly is a permanent institution. Therefore, it can remain operational even in the absence of the House of Representatives. Under normal circumstances, Speaker Timilsina initiated a positive practice by personally participating in different committees. Nevertheless, in the absence of the House of Representatives, the National Assembly often experienced inactivity. In December 2020, the Prime Minister at that time, KP Sharma Oli, dissolved the House of Representatives. Subsequently, a session of the National Assembly was convened on January 1, 2021. Despite lasting only seven hours over four days, this session, which took place after the dissolution, failed to address crucial public issues. Even after six months, important matters remained unaddressed within the House. On May 22, 2021, the UML-led government once again dissolved the House of Representatives. The meeting of the National Assembly and committees was affected once more. However, the dissolutions were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court,  reinstating the parliament . The Constitution says that despite the closing of the National Assembly session,  thematic committee  meetings can still take place. However, both the National Assembly and its committees remained inactive until the restoration of the House of Representatives. According to Khimlal Devkota, a member of the National Assembly, when the House of Representatives was dissolved twice, it seemed that the National Assembly was also in a state of dissolution. Bimala Rai Paudyal also believes that the inability to resume the upper house is a mark of weakness.  “Since the government was not in a position to call, the President needed to be consulted by the chair together with the consultation committee. That was not done either,” she says. Constitutional and legal distinctions Except for the Constitution of Nepal (1962) and the Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), all other constitutions in Nepal provided for a bicameral parliament with the National Assembly or the Upper House and the House of Representatives or the Lower House. The practices before 2015 were under the unitary governance system, but after the adoption of the federal democratic republican governance system, the role of the National Assembly has changed somewhat. In the preamble of the constitution prepared by the ‘Constituent Assembly, and Administrative Organ Designation Committee’ during the drafting of the constitution, it is mentioned that some different qualifications have been prescribed for being a member of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with the intention that qualified people can be represented in the National Assembly. Chair of the National Assembly Ganesh Prasad Timilsina restates that the members of the upper house should be assessed based on the country’s expectations with clear criteria.  There is no definite definition of an expert in the constitution. It has been stated symbolically, “…It is expected that the members should have some basic skills to face the challenges and fulfil their responsibilities.” According to the constitution, the responsibility of the National Assembly is to correctly establish the rights of the local level, state, and union, and to prevent the House of Representatives from trying to enact laws contrary to the spirit of federalism. There is an explanatory comment in the constitution about the propriety of the National Assembly – “This House is expected to fulfil its role to maintain creative and mutual relations between the national government and the provinces.” In addition, there are some constitutional and legal differences regarding the National Assembly. But the MPs are demanding that it should cease. When a bill originating in the House of Representatives is passed and sent to the National Assembly, and if the latter does not decide within 60 days, it proceeds de facto. This has placed the National Assembly in a dilemma. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Timilsina, says, “Such an arrangement should also apply to the House of Representatives, or both should be equal.” Need for course correction  Some instances have turned these so-called experts into a laughing stock due to their actions.  On July 5, 2023,  a discussion on the  Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) Bill 2023  was tabled in the National Assembly. However, the parliamentarians misunderstood the main point and instead discussed the matter of electricity. The MPs, who had not read the proposal, suggested that electricity consumption within Nepal should also be increased besides exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh. During the meeting, Ramesh Rijal, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, also mentioned that India would purchase electricity during the Prime Minister’s visit. Unfortunately, the bill was unanimously approved. Timilsina considers the incident an example, that in his six-year tenure, he does not want to remember. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat, termed the incident ‘a joke’ in the Parliament of Nepal.  “This is strong proof of the kind of MPs we have, who speak without knowing what they are talking about.”  Timilsina assumed the role of the speaker/chair of the National Assembly after the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic. He had the opportunity to establish the system and the dignity of the National Assembly. However, instead of setting a positive example, he will soon be retiring after being accused of playing tricks with the Speaker and showing interest in the work of the House of Representatives. Timilsina has repeatedly commented on the affairs of the House of Representatives. The latest instance was during a seminar on ‘Japan: Past, Present, and Future’ held in the capital on December 2, 2023, he publicly stated that the election results of the House of Representatives did not bode well. Pointing to the emergence of a new party and the victory of some independent candidates, he said, “In a democracy, you get to choose candidates, irrespective of their party affiliation. However, is the signal positive?” In August/ September 2022, Timilsina wrote a letter to the Election Commission, urging them to extend the tenure of Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Upon receiving a response stating that the Commission would not determine the tenure of the elected Parliament, Timilsina directed the Parliament Secretariat not to execute decisions made by the Management Committee after September 17, 2022. This created conflict between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Speaker of the National Assembly and in the crux of this dispute between the parties, the country had to bear the consequences of this conflict. Laws could not be enacted promptly, and the place once considered the domain of experts was overshadowed by the party’s interest.  A study conducted by the Democracy Resource Center Nepal (DRCN) on the legislative functioning of the National Assembly has revealed that the Upper House has passed some bills that go against the spirit of federalism. The report’s concluding remarks say, “…the bills passed by the House of Representatives have not undergone significant changes or discussions in the National Assembly. The conclusion section of the study states that – “Furthermore, some bills, contradicting the spirit of federalism and addressing the interests of interest groups, have been approved by the National Assembly.” Overall, in the last six years, parties have introduced individuals who, given their presentation level, have raised questions about the National Assembly’s justification. If there are no changes in the constitution, laws, and policies concerning the upper assembly, these concerns will persist.”",political

Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar arrives for Nepal-India Joint Commission meeting,"Kathmandu, January 4 External Affairs Minister of India Subrahmanyam Jaishankar  arrived in Kathmandu on Thursday morning to take part in the seventh meeting of the Nepal-India Joint Commission. Jaishankar was received at the Tribhuvan International Airport by Minister for Foreign Affairs NP Saud, Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal and other officials, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Indian External Affairs Minister is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on the President, the Prime Minister and other political party leaders, before a bilateral meeting with his Nepali counterpart at the Nepal-India Joint Commission. He will return home tomorrow. During his visit, the agreement is likely to be signed on power trade.

3 employees at Kathmandu Metropolitan City suspended,"Kathmandu, January 2 Three employees of the  Kathmandu Metropolitan City  have been suspended for irregularities while the Chief Administrative Officer Basant Adhikari has been asked to stay on leave.  According to the sources, a member of Mayor Balen Shah’s secretariat Nurnidhi Neupane, Health Department Chief Ram Prasad Paudel and Senior Branch Officer Bhagwati Bidari have been suspended. Adhikari was asked to stay on leave by  Mayor Balen Shah .  “Investigations are underway and the city will make its final decision soon,” said a source at the municipality. According to sources, there are suspicions that the decision issued by the Executive Committee was intentionally worded differently. Following the involvement of the chief administrative officer, Basant Adhikari, in this matter, the mayor has personally initiated an investigation.  Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s Executive Committee decided to retain five employees at the  Urban Health Promotion Center  in Ward Number 19. However, during the verification of the decision, it was discovered that six individuals were mentioned, leading to an investigation. The Urban Health Promotion Center had been operating with financial support from  Medecins Du Monde – France , but the funding was discontinued this year. To sustain the services, the executive meeting resolved to retain the staff. However, when the decision was documented, and the number appeared to have increased, Mayor Shah personally initiated an investigation. “It has been discovered that the number was manipulated in collusion to secure a job for an employee’s daughter,” said the source. “No one has the authority to overturn the decision of the executive.” Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, Ward 19 chair said that the proposal was to maintain only five employees, and the Executive Committee also reached the same decision. “But, I heard that something went wrong, I don’t know what happened”, he said. Naveen Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis, said that he could not comment on the matter as an investigation was underway. “The mayor has been conducting an investigation. I can only speak after it concludes,” said Manandhar.",political

"Prithvi Narayan Shah, in the light of current geostrategic challenges","Nepal, situated at the vortex of expanding interest of her neighbours in South Asia and southwest China, holds a unique  geopolitical position  in the region and the world. Nepal’s geographic location has always made it necessary for her to pursue a balanced foreign policy to gain goodwill from her immediate neighbours and other powers beyond the region. However, present-day Nepal has failed to attain these objectives. As a result, the country has become a venue for rivalry between the two regional powers and the powers beyond. Nepal should turn the pages of history and learn lessons from the past; she should adopt those policies from the past, which had enabled her to keep all foreign powers at arm’s length, ensure internal stability and thrive economically at the same time. Regional geopolitical history A brief survey of the regional geopolitical history illustrates that Nepal, shielded by the Himalayan rampart in the north and the thick malaria-infested forests in the southern Terai and further made inaccessible by  the Chure  and the Mahabharata ranges  had always remained a sovereign state. However, its immediate neighbours, Tibet and India, were not so fortunate. In the north, due to their domestic conflict, the Chinese intervened in Tibet’s internal affairs in the 1720s. Towards the south, the Mughal power in India started to collapse in the 1750s, and the English East India Company, who had entered India as traders, started reaping the rewards of their successful campaigns. Even in such a situation, the tiny principalities of this Himalayan region managed to remain isolated from regional politics, protected by these two formidable barriers. When  King Prithivi Narayan Shah  initiated his military campaign to unify Nepal in the north, the Chinese had already deputed their Amban (Chinese Military Governors) to monitor and control local events in Tibet in 1728. In the south, the  English East India Company  had established itself as a military power and vigorously expanded its control over the Indian subcontinent. However, the Gorkhas thwarted their ambitions and annihilated them at Shinduli on November 6, 1767. Based on his deep understanding of Nepal’s delicate geo-strategic location, the great strategist Prithvi Narayan Shah compared Nepal to a “ Yam between two boulders ” and stressed that Nepal must maintain a policy of equilibrium between its immediate neighbours. After the Anglo-Nepal War(1814-18160), the British curtailed Nepal’s expansion and rose as an undisputable power in the Indian subcontinent. Towards the north, by 1818, more than 10 countries, including Nepal, were sending tribute missions to China, and the Chinese considered these countries to be under their suzerainty. However, after 1840, the Northern Imperial power started to decline. Furthermore, the influence of France and Russia around the Indian subcontinent also started to decrease. Fluctuations in power are inevitable in geopolitics; thus, given the harsh international reality of the 19th century, the Ranas of Nepal adopted a realistic approach and sought a friendly relationship with the British in India. Yet, the Northern neighbour’s attempts to assert her claim over Nepal had not ended. In 1913, they had invited Nepal to join her in a union of the “Five Affiliated races  namely Han Chinese, Manchus, Mongolians, Tibetans, and Muslims.” They categorised Nepal amongst the so-called lost Chinese territories they hoped to reclaim. Thus, China sent numerous missions to Nepal to reaffirm its claim. Scholars mention that even in 1939, Mao Tse-tung had stated, “Nepal, Bhutan, and Burma were independent states that the Chinese had lost to the British Empire ”  The changed scenario in World War II World War II  completely changed the existing world order. The collapse of imperial powers and the flowering of nationalism in colonised countries was followed by India gaining independence in 1947 and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. After independence, India adopted a policy of integrating her smaller neighbours into her security perimeter to promote India’s interests. Amidst these regional changes, the Ranas, desperate to save their regime, signed the controversial Peace and Friendship and Trade and Commerce treaty with the Indians on July 31, 1950. According to scholars, the 1950 treaty attempted to abolish the sovereign status of Nepal recognised by the British through the 1923 treaty. However, because the UK, US and France had entered into diplomatic relations with Nepal before India gained independence, India refrained from taking direct action against Nepal, as it had done against the Indian princely states and Sikkim. Otherwise, Nepal’s fate would have been sealed if that had not been the case. Across the northern border, after what China terms “liberating Tibet” in 1950, Mao had stated, “Tibet as the palm and Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Ladakh and the north-eastern frontiers areas of India as the fingers.” This statement illustrates China’s regional policy and its initial views of Nepal during that period. Only from 1955 onwards, after the Bandung Conference, did China and Nepal establish preliminary contacts that paved the way for establishing diplomatic relations. Since then, the relationship has gained steady momentum in the ensuing years. At the beginning of the Cold War, the India – China relationship had been symbolised by  the slogan “Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai.”However, the honeymoon period ended after the brothers fought a war in 1962. Nepal’s unique geostrategic location between the two antagonistic powers of Asia, India and China, and the bitter relation between the United States and the Soviet Union ensured that almost all the powerful international actors became involved in Nepal. Thus, hoping to prevent the rise of communist movements in Nepal and to keep it safe from China’s and the former Soviet Union’s influence, the United States started to assist Nepal in the 1950s. During that period, Nepal took full advantage of the situation by exploiting the differences of interest between the neighbours and the global powers. Nepal’s diplomatic relationships  Nepal’s interaction history with our two immediate neighbours demonstrates that China has always remained the critical balancer in Nepal’s external politics. Using the Chinese factor, Bhimsen Thapa managed to keep the British at arm’s length while he advanced towards the areas west of River Mahakali. China has always supported independent decisions made by Nepal, from Nepal’s Zone of Peace proposal during the Cold War to the more dynamic, balanced diplomacy of the present era. On the other hand, after independence, India’s policy towards Nepal clearly illustrates that it desires to infringe on Nepal’s independent status and ultimately bring Nepal under her fold. India’s insolence has led to many political upheavals between the two countries. Determined to maintain their special status, time and again, the Indians have imposed blockades on Nepal and signed multiple agreements with various groups in Nepal, which has been detrimental to Nepal’s domestic and foreign policy. She has not only encroached on Nepali territory but even established military posts inside Nepal’s territory and laid claim to them. These incidents have exposed India’s true intentions, thus leading many intellectuals to conclude that India has engineered political changes in Nepal to assert control over Nepal. As for the US-Nepal relations, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ideological war ended, and the US interest in Nepal also faded. The American aid decreased substantially. However, with the recent rise of China, the US has sought to maintain closer links with India, and given Nepal’s geostrategic importance, their interest in Nepal has also increased. The Americans have thus sought to reengage more intensely with Nepal. Scholars have noted that the Trump administration had listed Nepal as a critical partner and sought to expand its defence relationship with Nepal. The present Biden administration aims to influence Nepal to shape the strategic environment in which China operates. They proposed a grant agreement under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in September 2017 to develop the country’s electrical transmission lines and road network. However, many critics interpret MCC as a part of the US Indo-Pacific Strategy directed against China. However, Delhi firmly believes the US Indo-Pacific Strategy is a concept that is not directed against a third country. The Chinese consider the US’s growing strategic interests in Nepal a threat and want to counter it. Thus, they have prioritised their relationship with Nepal, and as a sign of their goodwill, Beijing signed a transit transport agreement for third-country trade with Kathmandu in 2016. This agreement ended Nepal’s exclusive reliance on India for transit trade. Then, in May 2017, Nepal became a signatory to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) project. During President Xi Jinping’s visit to Nepal in 2019, Nepal and China upgraded their comprehensive partnership to a strategic cooperation. The northern neighbour has established close military and security relations with Nepal and has overtaken India and the US in terms of military aid in recent years. Both of Nepal’s strong neighbours have adopted different policies towards Nepal. Furthermore, with the US’s determination to place Nepal at the vanguard of their China strategy Prithvi Narayan Shah’s Yam is caught between these three boulders and has become the focal point of their competition. Lessons to learn from King Prithvi Narayan Shah In such a scenario, Nepal must heed the past, take lessons from  King Prithvi Narayan Shah  and adopt his policies. He had managed to keep all the foreign powers at arm’s length while at the same time ensuring internal stability and a thriving economy. He was an astute politician who understood that external affairs are an extension of internal affairs. An analytic study of his Divya Upadesh (final instructions) clearly illustrates that he strove for internal stability by looking after the welfare of the citizens. He strengthened the military capability of the country and then cautioned that Nepal’s external affairs should aim to maintain a treaty of friendship with the emperor of China and also keep a treaty of friendship with the emperor of the southern sea. The great king’s quote not only reflects the essence of unified Nepal’s external and security policy but also contributes to determining her worldview. His instructions have served as a guideline for the Nepali rulers throughout history. Whenever the rulers of Nepal have failed to act according to these warnings and tried to divert internal political conflicts to the external sphere, they have invited trouble. India believes that Nepal has always remained under its sphere of influence and, thus, does not want China and the US to threaten its leverage, which they term a Big Brother role. Nepal should not discard India’s Big Brother role. Yet, it needs to adopt a strategy to keep them from interfering in Nepal’s internal affairs, solve the border issues and focus mainly on better managing economic ties. China does not want an increased US presence in Nepal and desires to see Nepal prosper in her manner and not in the American way. Regarding China, Nepal should ensure that no anti-Chinese activities are conducted on Nepali soil and cautiously prioritise those projects that enhance Nepal’s national interests. The United States thinks Chinese influence over Nepal is malign for their interest. Nepal should become prudent and ensure that its partnership with the US focuses entirely on economic development and ensures its engagement with the United States does not threaten its immediate neighbour’s national interest and security. Therefore, present-day Nepal should abide by the great king’s instructions and use its geostrategic location to its advantage as the past rulers had done while dealing with the neighbouring emperors across the sea. Nepal should strive for internal stability and enhance national unity to present a united front. It must maintain diplomatic relations with its neighbours and the powers beyond in a sensitive manner to widen its room for manoeuvring, protecting and promoting its national interests. At the same time, it should maintain a strategic balance and respect the fundamental strategic concerns of these global powers, which are unwilling to lose Nepal to the other side and prevent Nepal from emerging as the centre of the geopolitical rivalry of the global powers.",political

NEA v Industries: Dedicated feeders and trunk lines controversy explained,"On December 22, the  Nepal Electricity Authority  disconnected power to four factories citing unpaid dues. On December 24, the  NEA cut down the power of four more factories  escalating the dedicated feeders and trunk lines dispute between the NEA and various factories in the country, drawing attention even from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The conflict revolves around the back-dated bills issued by NEA Managing Director Kulman Ghising, which aim at boosting profits. Factories across Nepal, however, feel the back-dated bills are unfair and have chosen not to pay the due amount. This, however, has now resulted in the NEA cutting down power which seems to have the support of Prime Minister Dahal. Load shedding for domestic customers ended eight years ago, and for industrial customers, five years ago. However, a persistent controversy has arisen following the NEA’s claim of outstanding amounts from industries that used dedicated feeders and trunk lines during the load-shedding period. The NEA argues that these industries and factories are obligated to pay a premium amount for using electricity during the load-shedding period, while the industries are resisting such payments. The dispute over this issue remains unresolved, primarily due to the strong-handed approach of NEA MD Ghising, especially concerning the dedicated lines. Ghising’s stance and handling of the situation have contributed to the ongoing tension and impasse in resolving the disagreement over premium charges for dedicated feeders and trunk lines. In 2018, NEA wrote to 58 factories telling them to pay the outstanding amount which was Rs 10.14 billion. This, NEA said, accounted for the premium that was not levied on the factories from 2015 onwards. However, all the industries where the letters were sent had paid the regular bills for that period. After the letter was sent, most factories then refused to pay the premium fee stating how they had been subject to load shedding and how they could not use electricity when they wanted even though they were being provided the dedicated feeders and trunk lines. Now that amount has exceeded Rs 20 billion. Kulman Ghising, who gained acclaim for ending load shedding, has surprisingly been harsh towards the issue of dedicated feeders and trunk lines. His approach and handling of the matter related to premium charges for dedicated feeders and trunk lines have raised eyebrows and generated disappointment among stakeholders.  What are dedicated feeders and trunk lines? A dedicated feeder involves the supply of electricity through a separate line directly from a substation. This feeder system ensures continuous power supply even during load shedding by allowing electricity to be provided from an alternative line when one is subject to load shedding. On the other hand, a trunk line delivers electricity from the transmission line to the industry by placing a transformer inside the industry itself. In the past, during periods of load shedding in Nepal, essential services such as important government offices, security-related offices, hospitals, telecommunication towers, etc., received regular electricity supply through dedicated feeders and trunk lines. Additionally, certain factories in key industrial corridors like Biratnagar-Duhabi and Birgunj-Pathalaiya used electricity sourced from these lines. The NEA has provided this service to 298 customers during this period. How did the factories get electricity from the dedicated line? Due to load shedding, industries using generators lobbied for a government initiative allowing them to purchase dedicated electricity, akin to arrangements for government agencies and hospitals. On October 20, 2013, the NEA, under the leadership of Managing Director Mukesh Kafle, announced in Gorkhapatra that customers could buy electricity from dedicated feeders. The notice specified measures to prevent adverse effects on the general public during prolonged electricity supply to industries, with additional charges for such arrangements. On December 31, 2013, the NEA decided to impose additional charges on electricity supplied through dedicated feeders. To address this matter, a committee was established, chaired by the then Managing Director Manoj Kumar Mishra, to study and recommend charges for customers connected to dedicated feeders. Following the committee’s recommendations, the authority’s board of directors, during its 710th meeting on June 27, 2015, approved the imposition of premium fees. The committee’s report classified electricity feeders into separated feeders with load shedding and dedicated feeders with uninterrupted service. The decision was made to provide continuous 24-hour electricity through dedicated feeders. However, it appears that there were instances of misconduct during the decision-making process for providing dedicated feeders to factories The Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission, akin to the role of the Electricity Regulatory Commission, was responsible for setting electricity tariffs. Tariffs could only be implemented after being established and fixed by the Commission. However, without setting the fee, the NEA directed subordinate offices on September 1, 2015, to collect the fee accordingly. The communication stated that customers using ‘Time of Day (TOD)’ metres and receiving continuous 24-hour electricity would be subject to a premium charge. On January 3, 2016, the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission told the NEA that the decision to set the tariff through the board of directors was faulty. This information was also forwarded to the  Commission of Abuse of Authority Investigation in Nepal  and the  National Vigilance Centre . Subsequently, the authority retracted its decision, seeking approval for the new tariff from the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission. The Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission finalised the new tariff on January 13, 2016, with the information published in Gorkhapatra on January 24. Notably, the notice did not address matters related to the trunk line. Despite this, Kulman Ghising personally wrote to certain customers, urging them to pay the fee from July 2015 onwards. However, Shivam Cements Company challenged the tariff imposition. In response, the Supreme Court ruled that the new tariffs could only be implemented after the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission formally determined them. As per the Supreme Court’s decision, the NEA could not collect the premium fee for electricity consumed before January 13, 2016. On February 23, 2016, the NEA issued a notice announcing the suspension of electricity supply from the dedicated feeder to private sector establishments and industries, excluding government hospitals, educational institutions, or offices. This decision was attributed to a decrease in the water level of rivers. The suspension would persist until a further decision was made by the authorities. Industrialists argued that the supply of dedicated feeders, suspended since February 23, 2016, has not been resumed, leaving them to endure load shedding. Despite this, industrialists express their willingness to pay for a continuous 24-hour supply through the Time of Day (TOD) metre. The matter has led to a dispute regarding whether the NEA has reinstated electricity supply to the dedicated feeders and trunk lines after February 23. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the request to review the case due to the disagreement over whether the NEA has resumed electricity supply to dedicated feeders and trunk lines. The case is currently pending in the Supreme Court. On December 19, 2016, the Authority’s Board of Directors approved the ‘Electricity Tariff Collection Regulations 2016,’ with a specified implementation date of July 16, 2016. This raises questions, as to how could the regulations approved in December could have been implemented six months prior. Such discrepancies suggest potential fraudulent practices by the authority. Furthermore, the regulations diverged from the decision made by the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission on June 30, 2016. The commission had decided that in cases of load shedding for six hours or more, customers receiving continuous electricity supply from a separate trunk line for 20 hours or more would be categorised as dedicated. However, the regulations altered this decision by removing the term “customers who receive power supply ’24 hours a day’ through a dedicated line or who receive continuous power supply for more than 20 hours a day through a trunk line when there is load shedding for more than six hours a day.” Instead, it introduced the provision that “customers who receive power supply through a dedicated and trunk line of the authority” would be charged as per schedule 2. This discrepancy implies that the authority misrepresented the commission’s decision in the regulations, a fraudulent act. Notably, the authority cannot implement a tariff that has not been determined by the commission, and the decision appears to have been made by Executive Director Kulman from the board of directors. The premium tariff for dedicated and trunk line services was established on January 13, 2016. Notably, government hospitals, educational institutions, government offices, and non-dedicated line establishments were initially exempt from the premium fee. However, this exemption did not extend to dedicated line consumers in industries and certain establishments. The committee, headed by Bhakta Bahadur Pun and appointed by the Nepal Electricity Authority, identified 298 customers using electricity from dedicated and trunk lines. Out of this total, 184 industries were subject to billing based on the dedicated line tariff. Additionally, 50 clients comprised government-level hospitals and community water projects. In February and March of 2019, the NEA took action by consolidating bills for three years, stating that 58 customers failed to remit the dedicated line tariff. It is noteworthy that during this period, these industries were already paying the standard tariff applicable at that time. In 2019, Kulman Ghising implemented a simultaneous disconnection for certain factories, spanning from July 2016 to April 2020. Criticism from industrialists arose, claiming that the lack of information regarding their electricity consumption over three years, uncertainty about load shedding status, and the abrupt clearance of old bills seemed unjust. Despite these concerns, premium charges continued to be levied until July 2020. The Board of Directors of NEA implemented the Electricity Tariff Collection Regulations in 2016. Under these regulations, a special tariff rate, inclusive of premium charges, had been established for industrial, commercial, and non-commercial customers receiving power supply from dedicated feeders and trunk lines since July 2016. In the event of load shedding, a provision stipulates that a line supplying electricity 24/7 is deemed dedicated. Moreover, a trunk line, consistently powered for 24 hours during a minimum of six hours of load shedding, will incur the same tariff as a dedicated line. To avail themselves of these benefits, customers must apply to the authority, and approval from the Board of Directors is required before accessing these privileges. In sub-regulation (2) of regulation (5), industrial, commercial, and non-commercial customers using the authority’s dedicated and trunk lines must pay monthly service, demand, and energy fees as outlined in schedule 1a. Moreover, unless otherwise specified in sub-regulation (5) of regulation (5), customers currently supplied by the trunk line can access power for 20 hours or more, akin to a dedicated feeder, by paying the dedicated feeder tariff. Approval from the Board of Directors is required for such service applications, mirroring the process for a dedicated line. Industries in disputes over dedicated and trunk lines claim they haven’t applied for these connections, lack board approval, and haven’t received continuous electricity for over 20 hours, as per regulations. The authority, however, has failed to furnish evidence detailing the process by which it connected lines to industries lacking the proper authorization to consume electricity from dedicated feeders or trunk lines. Additionally, the same regulation increased fees for ordinary customers, a rate the authority has collected since July 16, 2016. The regulation states that taxes must be levied based on the readings of the TOD (Time of Day) metre, and the total TOD data is closely monitored. Even if the process mentioned by the regulatory framework is not fully implemented, industries have expressed their readiness to pay the premium tariff if the TOD metre consistently shows an electrical consumption exceeding 20 hours per day during electricity cut-off, as revealed by the Authority. The TOD metre used in industries is a smart metre that provides real-time data on which day and for how long electricity has been used by the consumer. In a note sent to factories on September 1, 2015, the Authority directed them to install TOD metres. If electricity is consistently consumed around the clock, NEA said a premium tariff would be enforced, resulting in corresponding charges. However, a lawyer explains that there is no law stipulating the imposition of a premium rate when the Authority fails to provide a TOD metre to the consumer and the power supply extends for only an hour. Presently, amidst the dispute involving 58 enterprises, only one industrialist has expressed a willingness to comply with the premium tariff. “In terms of procedure, we are prepared to pay if there is a formal request letter for dedicated feeders and trunk lines submitted to the Authority, accompanied by evidence of approval obtained during the authority’s board meeting, and electricity has indeed been supplied at the specified time,” says an industrialist.  The Authority has control over this metre and has collected fees from factories based on it. Factories and enterprises involved in the dispute over dedicated and trunk lines said that they are ready to pay the premium fee if TOD shows continuous use of power for more than 20 hours during the electricity power cut. Kulman Ghising, however, has chosen to shut down the primary electricity lines of the factories instead of providing evidence and information to the industrialists regarding TOD. The industrialists, willing to adhere to the billing procedure, question why Ghising is not collecting the fee by presenting the available facts and evidence, especially when the relevant data is within Ghising’s office. In Regulation number 20 of the Authority’s Electricity Distribution Regulations, it is stipulated that in the case of a billing discount for a customer, approval from the authorised officer, as outlined in Schedule 29, is required for discount billing. As per Schedule 29, the designated officials with the right to make decisions concerning bill exemptions are specified. According to this schedule, the office chief has the authority to make decisions up to Rs 2,000 at once, office chiefs ranging from 8 to 9 up to Rs 5,000, regional chiefs up to Rs 50,000, the director-general up to Rs 100,000, and chief administrative officers can make decisions exceeding Rs 100,000 concerning bill exemptions in a single instance. However, an exception is made for Ghising himself, granting him the right to decide on bill exemptions exceeding Rs 100,000. Despite this authorisation, he has not personally made any decisions regarding bill exemptions. Notably, Ghising had sent the bill without making any decision before disconnecting the electricity supply for an outstanding amount exceeding Rs 1 million. The provision in the Electricity Distribution Regulations asserts that if a customer surpasses the specified time for electricity usage, bypasses scheduled power cut hours, and engages in unauthorized use of electricity, the authority has the power to disconnect the line under the Theft Control Act, 2001, Section 9. Additionally, fines and compensation can be imposed according to Section 11. However, the authority has not demonstrated interest in recovering the amount through this process. This provision has been in effect since February 23, 2016, for electricity power cuts.   The Nepal Electricity Authority had declared the total discontinuation of power cuts in Nepal starting from May 14, 2018. Despite this announcement, Kulman implemented billing adjustments for February to April 2017, a period during which the Authority itself had officially ended power cuts. Moreover, the Authority continued billing, inclusive of the premium charge, until the fiscal year 2020/21. Despite the recommendations from the Study Committee led by the then Energy Secretary Dinesh Ghimire, advising against imposing additional charges on industries for the period preceding the determination of electricity tariff by the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission and after the cessation of power cuts by the Authority, both of these suggestions were disregarded by the Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission. The Cabinet endorsed the committee’s report on August 3, 2020; however, its implementation has not been executed thus far. Why is Kulman Ghising not budging? According to the decision of the Nepal Electricity Authority’s Executive Committee, legal experts suggest that the Authority has the option to disengage from the matter of incorrectly issued bills. In line with the resolution of the 108th meeting of the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission, if electricity is consumed for more than 20 hours daily on the TOD metre, a decision has been reached to apply the premium fee. Consequently, if Ghising takes sincere measures, this issue could potentially be resolved conclusively. Specifically, the Managing Director himself is required to make this decision. Yet, the Authority’s management retains the ability to make decisions on this matter since it has already set the electricity tariff. While the Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission previously held the responsibility for tariff determination, it now falls under the jurisdiction of the Electricity Regulatory Commission. According to the law, the regulatory commission possesses the authority to address disputes between consumers and service providers. Export-oriented industry faces blow The cement industry has been severely impacted by the shutting down of power and the back-dated bills associated with dedicated feeders and trunk lines. Despite being a symbol of self-reliance over the past decade, the industry now faces a crisis, largely attributed to what is perceived as coercive tactics by NEA and Ghising. While Ghising received acclaim for eliminating power cuts and gaining popularity, his actions have had adverse effects on the cement sector.  In a departure from principles of justice, the open mistreatment of entrepreneurs by a state entity has occurred without intervention, and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has maintained silence for an extended period, raising concerns about Kulman Ghising’s continued tenure.",political
"Govt approves guideline mandating use of social media, including TikTok, by public offices","Kathmandu, December 22. The Council of Ministers, in its meeting on Thursday, approved the ‘Guidelines for the use of social media by government offices, 2023,’ mandating government entities to use social media platforms for disseminating information regarding their activities and upcoming initiatives. As per the guidelines, user accounts created for this purpose must include details such as name, address, contact number, and email in both Nepali and English languages, ensuring accessibility to the general public. For user accounts associated with the Prime Minister, Minister, or the head of relevant agencies, the inclusion of an official photograph is permitted. The  Ministry of Communication and Information Technology  will play a role in verifying the authenticity of these accounts. The guidelines state the government office’s social media accounts must maintain regular updates, incorporating progress reports. Furthermore, it also specifies that in response to received complaints, messages, or information, informed and timely replies should be provided following a thorough study and analysis. In instances where users convey abusive language, rude or obscene content, or negative messages that disrupt social harmony, the guidelines allow for the inclusion of such individuals in a block list. This measure aims to ensure a conducive and respectful online environment within the user accounts managed by government offices. The guidelines also specify the government offices authorised to create accounts on various social networks, including TikTok.

Ukraine sets conditions for release of Nepalis under its custody,"Kathmandu, December 15 Ukraine has set a condition for the release of Nepalis  captured from the battlefield after joining the Russian Army . While it is reported that Ukraine has taken a certain position and set certain conditions in response to diplomatic efforts led by the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  on behalf of Nepal, the exact nature of this position remains unclear. According to diplomatic sources, Nepal is actively pursuing initiatives to release its citizens serving in the Russian Army through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ukrainian embassy in Delhi, and its embassy in Germany.  Ukraine, however, has not provided a formal response to Nepal’s correspondence at this point. However, diplomatic channels indicate that Ukraine has communicated certain requirements or commitments it expects from Nepal to release these individuals. “Until now, Ukraine has not sent any official response to the diplomatic notes sent by Nepal. But it is understood that they are looking for a commitment about what will happen after their release”, a high-ranking government source told Onlinekhabar on the condition of anonymity. “Nepal is waiting for a concrete formal answer from Ukraine. Till then, Nepal is engaging in internal discussions to determine the legal commitments it is willing to make.” As of now, the number of Nepalis who enlisted in the Russian Army and were apprehended by Ukrainian security forces has risen to four, with six reported dead. While data is available for those captured by Ukrainian forces, the numbers for Nepalis in other Russian military units remain unconfirmed. Foreign Minister NP Saud has confirmed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has initiated diplomatic efforts for the release of the four Nepalis held by Ukrainian security forces. However, he did not provide specific details regarding the nature of these initiatives or the progress made in the diplomatic process.  “We are seeking help from the embassy of Ukraine in Delhi and the Nepali embassy in Germany. We hope to find a way to bring them back soon,” said Saud. Saud, however, did not want to talk about the conditions put forward by Ukraine.  “We are more focused on what we can do to bring them back at the earliest rather than focussing on the conditions,” he said. According to sources, Ukraine is awaiting a response from Nepal regarding the matter of preventing Nepalis individuals from participating in the war by enlisting in the Russian Army. Additionally, Ukraine is seeking clarification on the legal actions Nepal intends to take after the repatriation of Nepalis currently under Ukrainian control.  As of now, the exact number of Nepalis enlisting in the Russian Army is not confirmed, but it is believed to be around 500 individuals.",political

Empowering Nepal’s future: The rise of youth in politics,"Nepal experienced a notable change in its political landscape, signalling the dawn of a fresh era characterised by increased political empowerment, especially among the younger generation during the  2022 election  cycle. This change, with youth in politics, has developed faith among the people that the country will progress with the energy of the youth force in policy-making positions.  Nepal’s history is saturated with instances where youth acted as catalysts for change. From the  People’s Movement , the passion and drive of the youth facilitated transformative shifts in the nation’s political landscape. Despite their significant contributions, the youth often lacked recognition and representation in mainstream politics, their sacrifices overshadowed by the pursuit of power and position by established leaders. Present scenario Recent elections showcased a burgeoning foundation for youth in politics and policymaking. According to the election commission’s press release, there was an encouraging more than 40 per cent increase in youth representation in local elections, with 11 per cent of candidates falling in the 21-30 age group and around 30 per cent in the 31-40 bracket. Notable victories, such as  Balendra Shah ‘s mayoral win in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, signalled a turning point, fostering a trend of supporting young and independent candidates over those from established political parties. This shift birthed the emergence of the  Rastriya Swatantra Party , led by media personality Rabi Lamichhane, showcasing a promising wave of new faces and youth in politics. Federal elections also witnessed a 32 per cent surge in youth participation compared to 2017. The influence of the youth in campaigns like the “No Not Campaign” resulted in the defeat of renowned politicians, signalling a positive message for Nepal’s political landscape. Probable reasons for increased interest The heightened involvement of Nepal’s youth in politics stems from several key factors. Access to enhanced educational opportunities has empowered them with a deeper understanding of governance and their pivotal role in shaping the nation’s future. Concurrently, the rapid increment of social media and technological advancements has provided a robust platform for their voices, enabling seamless advocacy for change and support mobilisation. Furthermore, a burgeoning desire for societal change, combined with a heightened awareness of social inequities and environmental issues, has ignited intense passion among the younger generation to actively engage in political discourse. Additionally, evolving leadership prospects within some political spheres have facilitated the rise of young leaders, acknowledged for their potential to offer innovative solutions to enduring challenges. Challenges However, the path for youth entering politics is not free of obstacles. The major among these challenges is the insufficiency of employment opportunities, leading to a stark unemployment rate of 19.2 per cent among Nepali youth, significantly higher than the overall rate of 2.7 per cent around the globe. Consequently, many seek opportunities abroad due to inadequate prospects locally. This migration of skilled professionals contributes to a detrimental brain drain, impacting Nepal’s growth. The reluctance of established leaders to integrate young politicians into significant roles and the restrictive constitutional and legal provisions further limit youth representation in political processes. Barriers like minimum age requirements for contesting elections and participation in constitutional committees hinder the infusion of fresh perspectives, impeding youth representation and engagement in policymaking. Future path To harness the full potential of Nepal’s youth, the country must create a conducive environment through supportive legal frameworks and electoral processes. Implementing comprehensive youth policies with defined action plans, realistic timelines, and adequate budgets is crucial. Empowering the youth as proactive change-makers necessitates redefining their roles and equipping them with decision-making skills, enabling substantial participation in shaping Nepal’s political landscape.",political

Operational scenario and challenges in Nepal’s provincial government,"The  provincial government  was introduced under the provincial system with the hope that the provinces would be powerful; the state authority would be properly utilised and the development would be competitive amongst the provinces before being developed as a whole nation.  The number of provinces was discussed many times and finally, all the  parties agreed on seven provinces . So, how did the seven provinces contribute to development as expected? Did the province boost both its internal revenue and national economic growth?   A well-thought-out discourse is required on the issue. Democratic republic system The democratic republic system was established in Nepal on the foundation of Maoist insurgency as civil war and people’s movement. While many countries adopt a democratic system, not all of them have a federal system of government. The  federal system of government  is a new experience for Nepal. After 2017, the governments at all levels have completed five years. It is essential to take stock of these achievements and challenges in the implementation of the federal governance system and this is the right time. Sections 197 to 202 of Part 15 of the Constitution of Nepal have provided provisions regarding the provincial government management procedure. The arrangement of the Provincial Assembly is as mentioned in the provisions of the Provincial Executive in Part 13 of the Constitution of Nepal, Provincial Legislature in Part 14, Provincial Management Procedures in Part 15 and Economic Procedures in Part 16. The main function of the provincial assembly is to form the government, make provincial laws, monitor the activities of the provincial government and discuss provincial public affairs issues in the provincial assembly.  Structurally, achievements have certainly been seen at the provincial level. The provincial assembly is formed under the legislature and the executive. Ministries, directorates, commissions and offices have been established, while the departments, institutions, committees and boards under the union have been transferred to the provinces. Similarly, the Public Service Commission has also been formed in the province. After surveying the organisation and management, the administrative structure was created and the employees were adjusted in the province. All provinces have also designated permanent capitals. In the same way, service delivery structures within the province have also been developed at the provincial level. It is said that the federal government system has been strengthened by promoting coordination, collaboration and cooperation between the three levels of government. It does not seem that the coordination is vertical and the third relationship is strengthened. Although those levels accept cooperation, coexistence and coordination, it is not seen practically. Different forms of problems have emerged in terms of policy and practice in the province. The main task of the provincial assembly is to make mandatory provincial laws for running the provincial government.  Until now, more than 240 laws have been made by all provinces. Provincial assembly members themselves are saying in various forums that the law has been made to run the government, but the policy has not been made to match the needs of the people. Inter-level consultation was not made mandatory in lawmaking. Due to the lack of legal uniformity between the federal, provincial and local levels, the implementation of the program has become complicated.  It is necessary to confirm the necessity and propriety of the law. Now that the main laws have been made, the rest of the work of the provincial assembly is to amend and review conflicting laws. The operational challenge  No matter what kind of government system is formed, it will ultimately serve the people. Good governance is to fully utilise the money in the country’s treasury and spend it on the overall development of the country.   How the money is collected, how the plans are selected, how the plans are implemented and how the people get their benefit is the main issue.   The provincial government’s social and physical infrastructure plans, encompassing areas such as drinking water, building construction, road, and bridge construction, are subjects of general interest. The selection and implementation of these plans involve citizen participation, reflecting principles of good governance. These projects are then implemented in settlements at the local level. The market question is, how and which methodology do the provincial ministries use to select the said project? Quality maintenance and evaluation processes for activities in the provinces require coordination and cooperation with the local level. Currently, a significant challenge is observed when inquiring about the province’s plan at the local level, as local governments often lack awareness of the plan. This lack of coordination poses a crucial challenge in the effective implementation and evaluation of activities across different administrative levels. Good governance has become the most serious issue  in all three levels of government in a democratic republic.  According to the demand of the citizens, the provincial government has to bear the necessary expenses for development and service delivery from the income, but the imbalance between functional responsibilities and financial resources is visible.  There is a complaint at the local level that the province makes unnecessary conditions when transferring financial resources. Likewise, the relationship between the province and the local level is not cordial in the distribution of financial resources.   Even though there is an Inter-Governmental Finance Management Commission, which was formed for consultation on inter-governmental management including the financial partnership of the federal, provincial and local levels, it has not been effective.  Therefore, so far, it has been observed that the province expects maximum financial resources from the union and does not take any initiative to increase the internal income. Provincial and local levels are also trying to be autonomous, but due to excessive dependence on financial resources, these two levels are currently unable to be independent. The need for cooperation, coexistence and coordination  Citizens had many expectations from the provincial government. Now, expectations have converted into complaints that the provincial government is formed as a training centre for employees. There are more charges such as investing in unproductive areas, having a centralised mentality, mentally considering the lower government to be of lower status as a lower government, and being indifferent to strengthening the local government, etc.   Similarly, there are allegations that there is a weakness in the management of the provincial government. It has not been able to improve its operations and it has not paid attention to development. Likewise, it has been confused in choosing small schemes, and it has been accused of choosing the wrong plan due to the influence of party bias. The inability of the provincial government to generate internal revenue, inability to choose quality projects, duplicity in projects, lack of interest in resource management in security conditions, weak financial discipline, mobilisation of resources only in the infrastructure sector, lack of analysis of sustainability, increasing activities under conditional grants, management of small projects. Problems such as being difficult to do, not being able to manage income tax, proposing a full budget when the government transfers finances to the local level, and not being able to make the budget formulation process participative, transparent and result-oriented are seen as urgent problems.  The annual budget expenditure rate is also about 50 per cent on an average of all seven provinces and the lowest position among the three layers of government. Even now, the political parties in the provincial government are only trying to gain power and an edge rather than strengthen the federal system. The most important thing is the selection of the project to the high demand of people to be conducted by the provincial government and the connection of the people in the implementation, monitoring, and benefit distribution. If the provincial government is not able to prioritise based on the demand and recommend the local government, there will be no justification for the provincial government. Likewise, the subject of cooperation, coexistence and coordination as provided by the constitution is vital.  Politically, any problems should be solved first. The capacity of the state level is not as satisfactory as expected. There is still a delay in law-making, employees have been kept under contract, and it seems that most of the employees are transferred within a short period.  At least one employee can be institutionalised only if he stays in one station for two years. Due to the new federal civil law, the laws made by the states have not been fully implemented. Because of that, for the stability of the provincial government, it is necessary to reduce the number of ministries, create a public-oriented transparent budget, prioritise projects, and put special emphasis on monitoring and evaluation.   The province should work within the scope of work as prescribed by the criteria for the classification and distribution of development programmes and projects at the Province and local levels as guided by the constitution.  Government employees also should pay attention to the psychology that the provincial government will remain in existence. Ultimately, doubt on sustainability will be expressed about the provincial assembly’s rationality if its members are unable to settle the conflict with federal law and demonstrate involvement beyond establishing a government and amending the remaining legislation rather than hanging around the ministries for tiny projects.",political

Chand along with party Spokesperson Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma (Prakanda), All Nepal Peasants’ Federation revolutionary Chair Raju Karki and Maila Tamang have been facing charges of an offence against the State in the court for the past four years. The case was filed against them on December 26, 2019, accusing them of jeopardising the relations among federal units and various castes and communities, thereby committing an offence against the State. The court issued the notice after the police reported to the court that they were absconding. In the statement issued under the signature of Biplav, it mentioned that the order of the arrest warrant is a direct violation of the  three-point agreement made with the government on March 5, 2021 , and also an attack on the initiative being taken to resolve the country’s problems peacefully. The CPN has announced that it will hold a torch rally on December 5, burn the effigy of the judge on December 6, and hold a nationwide public demonstration on December 7.",political

Communication Ministry tells Supreme Court TikTok ban was necessary as it cannot be regulated,"Kathmandu, December 4 The  Ministry of Communication and Information Technology  in a written reply to the Supreme Court has said  TikTok was banned  as there were no ways to regulate the application. The court asked for a written response from the Ministry following writ petitions filed at the Apex court, urging it to overturn the government’s decision to  ban TikTok . On November 30, the Ministry of Communications submitted a written reply, stating TikTok’s self-regulation is inadequate and that real-time content removal is unfeasible, which forced the government to ban the platform. The Communication Ministry argued that singling out TikTok for regulation alone is impractical. Instead, the Ministry asserts the necessity of banning TikTok due to its failure to align with the principle of removing false and misleading content upon verification of its accuracy. The ministry, in its letter, states TikTok’s algorithm, designed to deliver personalised content based on user interests, encourages prolonged usage, leading to adverse effects on human health. In its written response, the ministry also argues that excessive use of TikTok is linked to issues such as insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, it states the platform is steering children and youth in inappropriate directions, fostering toxic psychological effects. Communication Ministry also states that TikTok has been implicated in displaying obscenity through its videos, soliciting immoral activities, conducting explicit actions via live broadcasts, and contributing to an increase in illegal activities.  “There has been a surge in unethical, unrestrained, and anti-social activities, particularly aimed at receiving gifts through live streaming on TikTok,” says the Ministry.  The Ministry also states that  TikTok has been banned in 28 other countries . However, in many of these countries, the ban is partial, often restricting TikTok usage to government devices only. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal provided a written response to the Supreme Court regarding the TikTok ban, alleging that the platform has propagated social disharmony. Stakeholders and lawyers submitted over 10 petitions to the Supreme Court, arguing that the government’s decision to ban TikTok infringes upon freedom of expression. During the hearing on November 21, the bench, led by Justice Binod Sharma, requested a written explanation from the government elucidating the rationale behind the TikTok ban. Upon receiving the written response, the Supreme Court directed that the case be scheduled for a full hearing starting on December 5.",political
"Key figures in fake Bhutanese refugee scam still in custody, investigation continues","Patan High Court on December 1  ordered  that the high-ranking defendants of the  fake Bhutanese refugee scam  remain in custody as the trial goes on. While the court ordered the release of half of those arrested in the case on bail, it did not release former minister  Top Bahadur Rayamajhi  and  former Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand . In addition to Khand, Indrajit Rai, an advisor to former Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, former Home Secretary Tek Narayan Pandey, and former lawmaker Ang Tawa Sherpa have also been ordered to be held in custody until the fake Bhutanese refugee scam proceedings are concluded. The police arrested 20 individuals in connection to the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Among them, 10 have been granted release on bail. There are 10 more people who are currently on the run. These individuals are accused of collecting millions of rupees from people by promising to facilitate their resettlement in the US as Bhutanese refugees.  On June 16, the  Kathmandu District Court  ordered the detention of 16 people involved in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. The accused then moved to the High Court against this order. But a joint bench of judges Janak Pandey and Prakash Kharel, upheld the order of the Kathmandu District Court, to keep eight individuals, including Indrajit Rai, Keshav Dulal, and Angtawa Sherpa, in custody. Both judges unanimously also agreed that Sanu Bhandari, Keshav Dulal, Sandesh Sharma, Angtawa Sherpa, Govinda Chaudhary, and Sagar Rai, who are directly involved in collecting money from the victims, should be remanded in custody. Bail bonds to a few The High Court also directed the release of six individuals on bail. Refugee leader  Tek Nath Rizal  has been asked to pay a bail amount of Rs 1.5 million. Rizal was granted bail after confirmation that he did not receive money from the accused. At 76 years old, he has been living in Nepal as a refugee and is deemed not to pose any risk of leaving the country. The court also released Sandeep Rayamajhi, son of Top Bahadur Ramayajhi on a bail of Rs 3 million. Sandeep also denied receiving money and has been confirmed not to be involved in the investigation. Another accused, Ramsharan KC, will be released upon payment of Rs 1.5 million in bail. Notably, Ramsharan KC was a victim himself and had filed a complaint against the accused with the Commission for Investigation of Abuse Of Authority. The High Court, recognising his health condition, has requested the specified bail amount for his release. Hajj Committee Chairperson Shamsher Mia  has been told to pay Rs 1 million in bail. The government vehicle allocated to him was reportedly misused for transporting fraudulent money. The High Court has directed Mia’s release on bail without detention, citing the lack of confirmed involvement in fraud or acceptance of money on his part. Former Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand’s secretary, Narendra KC, has been instructed to pay Rs 1 million in bail. As the victims did not recognize him and he denied the allegations in court statements, the High Court has ruled against his detention. The decision is influenced by the fact that his name was mentioned in the message exchange between Keshav Dulal and Tek Narayan Pandey. The High Court has requested a bail amount of Rs 1.5 million from Hari Bhakta Maharjan. Maharjan had demanded money from Sandesh Sharma to deposit in a cooperative. Based on this information and the absence of evidence indicating involvement in fraud, the High Court has ordered his release on bail. Tanka Kumar Gurung, who has been released after posting a bail of Rs 1 million, has been asked to be released on a general date. The High Court has made this decision considering that the accused’s presence at the hotel and restaurant for meetings, operated by Gurung, does not confirm his direct involvement. Therefore, the High Court has ordered his release without having to pay a bail amount. The High Court has determined that Keshav Tuladhar should not be detained. The court reasoned that the victims did not mention his name, and the fact that the accused Hari Bhakta Maharjan used Tuladhar’s bank account for transactions does not necessarily imply his involvement in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Consequently, the High Court has ordered his release on a general date. Ashish Budhathoki has also been ordered to be released on a general date by the High Court. The court reasoned that since Budhathoki did not meet the victims and there is no evidence of him asking for money from anyone, he should not be detained. The High Court stressed that transferring money to an account should not be a basis for detention. Likewise, Lakshmi Maharjan has also been released on a general date. In her statement, she explained that her husband, Hari Bhakta Maharjan, managed her account and executed the transactions. Considering this and other factors, the High Court overturned the District Court’s order, which required Lakshmi Maharjan to pay a bail of Rs 500,000, and directed her release on a general date. Khand’s future In the case of the former Home Minister Khand, there is a division of opinions among the two judges. One judge did not find sufficient grounds for the decision to detain him, while the other expressed that, considering the available evidence, he should not be released on bail. The debate will now be presented to a third judge. Patan High Court Spokesperson Tirtha Raj Bhattarai mentioned that parties who are dissatisfied with the order have the option to appeal to the Supreme Court.  “After the corresponding paperwork is sent from here to the district court, the orders for the release of those individuals will be implemented.”",political
Finance Ministry tells NEA to collect dues from respective local levels,"Kathmandu, December 3 The  Ministry of Finance  has directed the  Nepal Electricity Authority  (NEA) to collect dues related to electricity tariffs for street lamps from the respective local levels. This directive aligns with the Ministry’s decision on November 8. It wants the NEA to settle the electricity dues from the respective offices and the highest dues are towards streetlamps. NEA says 331 local levels owe Rs 6.8 billion in electricity charges.  The Authority had previously, through its third financial restructuring plan, proposed to reconcile the unpaid tariff with the government’s account. However, the Finance Ministry declined to entertain the proposal and instead instructed the Authority to pursue the collection of payments directly from the respective local offices. “We have proceeded with the clearance of dues accordingly,” said NEA managing director Kulman Ghising. The Authority on October 8 issued a public notice seeking the payment of dues for streetlamps within the next 45 days and on November 22 called on local governments for the payment through a public notice. The Authority  disconnected the electricity supply  to various government offices due to their unpaid dues.",political

Why a monarchy falls short as a viable alternative to a republic,"A few weeks ago,  rallies and  meetings took place in various parts of the country, opposing federalism, advocating against the republic, and  expressing support for the monarchy . These protestors believe that the country would benefit from adopting a monarchy. They argue that an active monarchy, led by a king, is essential to eliminate disorder, anarchy, chaos, and  corruption  that have surfaced in the country. The notion that, until the eighteenth century, the active monarchical state system was connected to the feudal system of production and the resulting consciousness. The monarchical system represents a unitary state system, where citizens’ rights are constrained. It was abolished because it was considered anti-development, anti-competitive, and anti-freedom. We have not only studied the unitary state system and active monarchy but also lived through the challenging era of active monarchy and the panchayat system before transitioning to a republic. We have a history of nearly 70 years of struggle for the cessation of the monarchical state system in Nepal. Twelve years ago, the remnants of royal feudalism that had persisted were also eradicated. Therefore, it is essential to contemplate the reasons behind people demonstrating, including the demand for the unitary state system—an obsolete concept that has vanished from the world and was terminated a decade ago in Nepal. What are the internal and external causes? During the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the  Nepali people put an end to the monarchy . Following the monarchy’s abolition, as Nepal entered the republican state system, the constitution directed the country to advance on the path of socialism through full democracy. However, the conflict between the outdated truths, the old thought system, and the antiquated state machinery, along with the progressive constitution and the clash between the federal republic and unitary thinking forces, led to the ascent of the latter in the final stages.  This divergence from the sentiments envisioned by the constitution resulted in the current situation we are witnessing today. The country is marred by anarchy, riots, chaos, disorder, and corruption, causing devastation to people’s lives and weakening the economy. As a result of widespread disillusionment, dissatisfaction and anger among the people, the old-fashioned thinking, and the powers that have ended in history, have fueled that anger, dissatisfaction and contradiction. The situation appears to be heading towards concentration, with attempts to leverage religious sentiments by uniting the Hindu nation and advocating for the monarchy. It is essential to note that history cannot be reversed, and it would be imprudent to entertain the idea of reviving a unitary state that nearly ceased to exist in the 18th century. Suicidal to create a monarchy  In a context where the capitalist system is increasingly incapable of resolving global contradictions, advocating for a monarchy at a time when the future trajectory should be towards socialism with social justice is considered counterproductive.  While one can empathise with the discontent and anger expressed on the streets, it is neither reasonable nor democratic to advocate for the return of the monarchy and the slogan of “Jai Desh Jai Naresh” (Long Live the Country, Long Live the King). Such an idea is deemed anti-science, anti-progress, anti-history, and anti-democratic. Democracy and monarchy are opposites, just as it would be foolish to say that a tiger and a goat can be kept in the same cage, it would be very foolish to say that republic and monarchy, civil rights and monarchy can be kept in the same system.  Drawing an analogy, it is not sensible to assert that Tata Company should alter or replace a vehicle simply because a misguided guru has steered it towards causing accidents. The prudent course of action would be to deny driving permission to an uninformed Guruji who lacks comprehensive knowledge of how to operate a vehicle safely. The current street uproar resembles the proverbial scenario of a foolish daughter expressing anger by urinating on her husband’s lap. Therefore, the notion of restoring monarchy by undermining the republic is deemed a crude, undemocratic, and unpalatable joke. It is crucial to transcend this outdated notion. The correct course of action is to progress by addressing the deficiencies within the republic rather than resorting to regressive alternatives.",political

COP 28: Nepal’s proactive approach to secure compensation on the world stage,"Prime Minister  Pushpa Kamal Dahal left for the UAE  on Wednesday night to participate in  COP 28 . The draft of Dahal’s speech for COP 28 in Dubai, scheduled from November 30 to December 12, has been prepared. However, it remains uncertain whether Dahal will solely inform the global community about the  adverse impacts Nepal has endured due to climate change  or will issue a stern warning to developed nations. The goal might be to secure their commitment, along with support from the  international climate fund , for compensating the effects suffered by Nepal. Experts, however, argue that Nepal, a country experiencing disproportionate harm despite playing a minor role in climate change, has not sufficiently prepared its case for seeking compensation. Maheshwar Dhakal, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Forests and Environment says that comprehensive preparations have been undertaken for COP 28. The government team is actively engaged in the UAE to organise a ‘side event’ during COP 28. Leading up to COP 28, the government have been engaged in numerous preparatory activities. The Ministry of Forestry reported that discussions took place at various levels on how to approach this year’s COP.  In anticipation of COP 28, Prime Minister Dahal has publicly expressed the intention to internationalise the impact of climate change on Nepal and pursue compensation. Prior to the conference, on November 19, during a public address in Rukum East, Dahal emphasised the need to bring attention to the challenges faced by Nepal due to climate change on the international stage. Dahal has argued that Nepal has received insufficient funds from developed nations to address the impacts of climate change. “It is our right to secure increased funding from developed countries. This year’s emphasis will be on that,” Dahal said. Calling on developed countries to fulfil commitments Officials who are part of Dahal’s delegation say Nepal will call on the international community to demonstrate seriousness by highlighting Nepal’s commitments in various international forums, presenting the action plan formulated according to established goals, and providing updates on its implementation status. There is a growing sentiment that Nepal should enhance cooperation with countries significantly contributing to carbon emissions, the primary cause of global temperature rise, and actively pursue compensation for the resulting adverse effects. However, government officials express reservations, citing doubts about whether the voice of Nepal will be effectively heard due to insufficient preparation and groundwork. “The Prime Minister is strongly in favour of Nepal raising its issues in COP 28 and has asked various organisations to prepare for it accordingly”, says an official of the Office of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. The official highlighted that critical issues have been pinpointed in numerous government-level discussions leading up to COP 28, and the Prime Minister will prioritise addressing all three during his visit. Maheshwar Dhakal, Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Forests and Environment, shared that, under the Prime Minister’s leadership, a high-level side event titled ‘Question of the mountains: Who will save us from the climate crisis?’ is being organised. Dhakal further mentioned that Nepal will host 36 events, and will have a separate pavilion at COP 28. “We want to show how much Nepal has been impacted by climate change and share our stories with the rest of the world. We will show where were have been successful and where we have failed. We have photos and videos of how the climate crisis has impacted us,” says Dhakal. Clear focus Dhakal highlighted that, during COP 28, the emphasis will be on three significant issues. Firstly, the discussion will revolve around strategies to maximize climate finance for Nepal. Secondly, there will be an effort to exert pressure on the global community to diminish the usage of biofuels. Lastly, the focus will also be on how Nepal can benefit from the transfer of innovations and technologies. These key topics will be given prominence in the discussions at COP 28. “On one hand, our mountains are melting due to higher carbon emissions from other countries, and on the other hand, approximately 2 billion people in India and Bangladesh benefit from the water originating in our mountains, protected forests, and mountains,” says Dhakal. “The only people who are at risk are Nepalis.” Additionally, Dhakal highlights the campaign advocating for compensation as a rightful claim rather than as an afterthought or mere formality. Environmentalist Bhushan Tuladhar believes the government is going to COP 28 with a proper plan. Having been part of various discussions himself, Tuladhar feels the government’s plan for conducting side meetings and interactions at COP 28 was positive. “Negotiation within the COP is a different matter, but the way the government has identified the issues by holding the National Conference on Climate Change is positive”, he said. “Now it will be interesting to see how the government create pressure by showing how climate change has impacted Nepal. We should be assertive and demand compensation from the rest of the world.” The bigger picture Nepal has consistently highlighted its commitment to prioritising the reduction of high-rate carbon emissions, identified as a primary factor driving climate change. The country has developed an action plan and initiated its implementation. Despite these efforts, there is a challenge in getting countries with significant carbon emissions to compensate those nations that bear the brunt of climate change impacts. Recognising the urgency to limit the  global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius , it becomes critical for nations with substantial carbon emissions to contribute more significantly to global efforts. Countries like Nepal, located in the vulnerable high Himalayan region, are particularly susceptible to the rapid and severe impacts of climate change. These nations face the formidable challenge of mitigating these effects with limited resources while safeguarding local communities. Environmentalists, including Tuladhar, suggest that Nepal can engage with the global community on various platforms to discuss the risks stemming from climate change and its implications for development priorities. Given the escalating frequency of disasters such as floods, landslides, droughts, and fires in Nepal, addressing climate change has become a pressing and multifaceted concern for the country. The  reduction in mountain snowfall  and the  heightened risk of glacier breakage  have become evident, underscoring the impacts of climate change. In a significant prelude to the Climate Conference, UN Secretary-General  Antonio Guterres visited Nepal . During his visit, he personally observed the effects of climate change by touring Everest and the Annapurna base camp, gaining firsthand insights into the environmental challenges faced by the country.  “During his Nepal visit, the UN Secretary-General effectively communicated the Himalayan region’s climate change impacts, emphasising the risk of Nepal falling into a destructive cycle. This message, taken to COP 28, becomes a tool to exert pressure on nations needing heightened responsibility, urging global cooperation to address the urgent situation,” says Tuladhar. Joining hands with least developed countries According to the climate change report from the Ministry of Forestry, Nepal is already grappling with issues like climate-related disasters, food security challenges, and water scarcity due to the failure of major carbon-emitting countries to fulfil their commitments.  In the broader context of shared challenges among developing countries, Nepal, as the chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC), is positioned to advocate for common issues. The sixth report from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) stresses that the climate adaptation gap in developing nations, including Nepal, is substantial. The slow implementation of temperature rise reduction plans is expected to exacerbate this gap, emphasizing the critical need for accelerated action and international collaboration. Despite commitments, the flow of climate finance in Nepal is limited. According to the government, Nepal needs USD 21 billion US dollars to implement adaptation priorities by 2030. Initiatives are also necessary to facilitate easy access for Nepal to established funds dedicated to adaptation. Experts have also recommended that the government should consider expanding the size of internationally established funds such as the Green Climate Fund (Green Fund) and others. Additionally, they suggest simplifying the process for utilising these funds to enhance their accessibility and effectiveness in addressing climate-related challenges. That is not going to be easy as Nepal will have to lobby to remove the obstacles and establish direct access to the climate fund by making a commitment to increase the capacity to use such funds. Experts argue that COP 28 presents a significant opportunity to engage with relevant agencies and discuss issues surrounding inequality and other challenges observed in the allocation of funds. Environmentalist Tuladhar says the government’s actions following COP 28 will also be of utmost importance. “It’s not just about what Nepal brings to or takes away from COP; equally important is how the other 50 weeks of the year align with the climate change impact reduction plan,” he says. “Developing the capacity for this is a challenging question.” Rupak Sapkota, the advisor to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, says that there will be a resounding call at COP 28 for climate finance facilities to be swiftly, efficiently, and easily accessible for least developed and developing countries like Nepal. According to Sapkota, Nepal will actively advocate and take a leading role in bringing the concerns of mountainous regions to the forefront, building on the message delivered to the world by the United Nations Secretary-General. He says Nepal’s approach will now be limited to beg funds from the climate change funds but rather to draw global attention under the banner of ‘climate justice.’ This highlights a stance that focuses on fairness and equitable treatment in addressing the impacts of climate change, particularly for nations like Nepal.",political
Govt surveillance on additional social media apps sparks concerns for democracy and freedom of expression,"The government,  having banned TikTok , is now extending its monitoring efforts to include other social media platforms such as Telegram and Snapchat. Prakash Rayamajhi, the Prime Minister’s information technology expert, has indicated that studies are underway to explore regulatory measures or potential bans on these apps, similar to the  action taken against TikTok . The government states that it banned TikTok due to its impact on social harmony and family disruption. In the ongoing legal proceedings, the  Supreme Court  refrained from issuing an interim order. Instead, it  requested a written response  and has scheduled the final hearing for December 5. The court not issuing an interim order along with the support of one sphere of the society has motivated Pushpa Kamal Dahal to explore the possibility of regulating additional platforms in the country. Rayamajhi said a group of experts are currently studying if social media apps like Likee, IMO, Bigo, Tinder, TanTan, Bumble, Telegram and Snapchat should also be banned in Nepal. Rayamajhi claims that inappropriate behaviours are widespread on live streaming platforms such as Bigo Live, and there is an alarming occurrence of financial and sexual crimes taking place through messaging apps like IMO and Telegram. “There is an argument that social media apps have the power to negatively impact the psychology of the younger generation. That negative impact will affect society too,” said Rayamajhi, defending the government’s actions. “I call these apps anti-social sites, not social sites. We are looking if these apps need to be banned or the government can regulate them.” Rayamajhi said that decisions will be made considering the unique characteristics of the apps under surveillance and the societal impact they have generated. “There is a concern about the potential exposure of children to these apps where they can learn wrong things. There is also an argument about children being vulnerable to sexual abuse and criminal activities through these apps,” he said. “The ongoing study is mindful of these challenges.” He said that studies are also being conducted on the positive and negative sides of  gaming apps like PUBG  and Freefire and says parents have been complaining about their children getting addicted to these mobile games. “We know how well Nepali PUBG teams are doing on the i nternational stage . A team even took part in the recent  Asian Games . But there are examples of it having more negative effects than positive on society,” he said. “We are not biased towards any specific sites. We want to ensure the society does not suffer because of it.” Rayamajhi said the findings of their study will be released once complete. No decision yet Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, along with senior government ministers, however, say that discussions banning other social media apps have not even begun.  The spokesperson for the Prime Minister’s Office, Narayan Prasad Bhatta, says that he is not aware of any monitoring of additional social media apps and sites. “There has been no formal decision on this,” says Bhatta The spokesperson for the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Netra Prasad Subedi, also says there are no plans to ban other social network sites in a similar vein as TikTok any time soon. The government has recently introduced  Social Media Management Guidelines 2023  to regulate social media sites and apps. Experts express concern about potential government abuse, citing unclear provisions in the guidelines. The prime minister’s communication expert’s acknowledgement of monitoring other networks and apps has heightened these concerns.  Prabin Subedi, a cyber law expert, contends that the government’s  inclination to ban social networks without parliamentary legislation  contradicts the Constitution. He argues that making arbitrary decisions based on directives or executive actions, impacting human rights and freedom of expression, amounts to interference with civil liberties. “Internet freedom is very important in the 21st century, if any content on the Internet has a negative impact, action should be taken against it,” he says.",political

Tribhuvan University’s quest for a vice-chancellor stalled by political quandaries,"On November 5, after  Tribhuvan University  had been without a vice-chancellor for three days, Prof Dr Shiva Lal Bhusal was appointed as the acting vice-chancellor by the office of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. The appointment of Bhusal as the acting vice-chancellor for Tribhuvan University is limited to a three-month duration. To facilitate the selection of a permanent vice-chancellor, a search committee has been established, with  Minister of Education, Science, and Technology , Ashok Rai, leading the committee’s efforts. According to government regulations, the chancellor, who is the Prime Minister, is tasked with appointing the individual recommended by the search committee for the role of vice-chancellor. Despite this provision, the search committee has not initiated any procedures for the appointment as of now. Ministry sources suggest that the chancellor intends to delay the appointment of the vice-chancellor for a certain period. On November 25, the position of a member of the Public Service Commission became vacant, and the position of Registrar will be vacant on December 25 and on March 19, the position of the Rector will also become vacant. There are hints that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal wants to make appointments to all these positions together, relying on political consensus. This means it is highly likely that Tribhuvan University will not have a new vice-chancellor any time soon as the process is likely to take some time due to the prime minister’s preference for a synchronised approach to these appointments. The effect of political affiliation For nearly five decades, the chancellorship of Tribhuvan University was held by the King of Nepal. However, following the abolition of the monarchy in the aftermath of the  2006 People’s Movement , this responsibility was transferred to the prime minister. The prime minister was made the chancellor to strengthen the connection between the government and Tribhuvan University, aiming to improve educational quality, empower the university, and advance in areas like financial resources and physical development. This move was accompanied by the creation of the  University Grants Commission . However, recently, the chancellor’s role in the university has been somewhat limited, primarily providing political leverage to the ruling party. With the prime minister not allocating time, the university has time and again faced budget delays. Officials from most universities, except Kathmandu and Pokhara University, report ongoing delays in conducting these important meetings. Individuals appointed based on political affiliations also share the sentiment that the system of appointments by the prime minister needs reform. Prof Dr Dharma Kant Baskota, a former vice-chancellor appointed when the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party was in government, expresses concern about the extreme politicisation of Tribhuvan University. He suggests that restructuring the government’s role is necessary to address this issue, emphasising that when the prime minister is occupied with government affairs, sufficient attention is not given to the university. In all universities across the country, including Tribhuvan University, the chancellorship is held by the prime minister, the pro-chancellorship by the Minister of Education, and there’s a legal provision for appointing the vice-chancellor as the chief administrative executive. The chancellor holds the authority to appoint key officials such as the vice-chancellor, registrar, rector, and others. However, there is a prevailing practice where the prime minister leverages this authority to appoint university officials in alignment with his and the ruling parties’ interests. This practice has expanded to include appointments at the head and deputy head levels for various campuses in recent times. An employee of Tribhuvan University says that the effect of this can be seen in the smooth operation of Tribhuvan University. According to him, the then Chancellor KP Sharma Oli appointed a person close to him as the vice-chancellor.  When the vice-chancellor aligned the registrar and rector closely with the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party, no appointments were made from the Nepali Congress. Consequently, the student union affiliated with the Nepali Congress padlocked the university for 407 days over a span of four years. During this period, incidents of vandalism of university property and even physical assaults on a teacher occurred as expressions of protest. “The reason for all this is the prime minister being a politician and not a chancellor,” says a staff at Tribhuvan University. He argues that because officials are appointed based on political power, their allegiance is more inclined towards the political party rather than working for the development of the institution. “If the chancellor was from the academic background and appointed by the broad of trustees, these things would rarely be seen. Currently, everyone wants to be involved in politics here,” says the staff on condition of anonymity. Similarly, Chhatra Karki, the president of the Tribhuvan University Employee Association, advocates for a change in the government structure to put an end to the politics of partisanship at Tribhuvan University. “To free universities from the political whirlpool, the provision to appoint the prime minister as the chancellor of the university must be revised,” he says. Need for change According to a professor at TU, the positions of various officials have been vacant for months as the chancellor of the university is focused on political participation rather than on academic improvement.  “The day when officials are appointed on time at the TU is the day when I will believe things have changed,” he says.  The professor says that the leadership system under the chancellor, who lacks an understanding of the university’s sensitivity, has misled TU and other universities in the country. According to Shyam Raj Ojha, the president of the Free Student Union of Tribhuvan University Central Campus, a proposal to reconsider the system of appointing the prime minister as the chancellor was raised during the senate meeting. He argues that having the prime minister as the chancellor results in losses rather than gains for the university. Five years ago, a High-Level National Education Commission submitted a report emphasising the necessity to alter the government structure where the prime minister serves as the chancellor. The government-formed commission was tasked with analysing the prevailing situation in Nepal, offering recommendations for education development measures, guiding transformations in the education sector, and laying the groundwork for the development of a socialist-oriented economy in line with the constitution’s vision. The High-Level National Education Commission, comprising 24 members, was established by the Cabinet decision on July 6, 2018, under the leadership of the then Minister of Education, Giri Raj Mani Pokharel. After thorough research, the commission presented a report with recommendations. One key suggestion in the report proposed a change in the current system, advocating for the selection of the vice-chancellor through the Board of Trustees rather than the prime minister. “Since the chancellor of Tribhuvan University becomes a political figure, there has been a misuse of political and party interests within the university,” says former vice-chancellor, Prof Dr Kamal Krishna Joshi, “Therefore, having political leadership as the chancellor is not conducive to improving Tribhuvan University. Due to political leadership, incorrect political practices have infiltrated the university.” He suggests promptly amending the law, forming a Board of Trustees, and appointing an academic figure as the chancellor. The benefit of political appointments Appointments to university positions based on political affiliations are alleged to come with financial benefits, raising concerns about potential economic gains for the appointed individuals, be it in the role of the chancellor or within associated political parties. “These appointments are connected with the power of political parties. Criticism is reduced when one is in the leadership of various bodies, either individually or as a party member, and the party gets support to demonstrate power when necessary,” says Ojha. Therefore, he says that the chancellor has created a means of accumulating power by appointing his own people to the university. According to educationist Prof Dr Bidya Nath Koirala, most political leaders cannot tolerate criticism and want officials who work according to their interests rather than having officials working in the institution as a place to produce academic and critical manpower. Koirala says that the chancellor should be an academic person and adds, “The prime minister of the party is appointing party officials whose interests match his own and deploying them according to his interests.”",political
"Govt restricts registration, service expansion of saving and credit cooperatives","Kathmandu, November 24 The government has disallowed registration, service expansion and establishment of service centres for cooperatives of any nature. The  Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation  has urged relevant authorities concerned to endorse the decision of the Council of Ministers to suspend the registration, service expansion and permission of service centres related to cooperatives, particularly to those meant for saving and credit services until further provisions are made. As said by Ministry Spokesperson Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, recent developments in the cooperative sector are likely to have adverse effects in the overall financial sector and it was decided to put restrictions on saving and credit cooperative business through the Cabinet decision on November 9. According to the Ministry, there is a  concerning trend among many saving and credit cooperatives  which are in significant numbers across the country to accept huge deposits and invest in high-risk sectors. Similarly, the cooperative sector is grappling with a financial crisis as members and depositors are facing challenges in retrieving their savings.",political
Nepal’s TikTok conundrum,"On November 13, the government of Nepal banned TikTok stating the platform disrupted social harmony along with family structure and relationships. The reaction since has been mixed. People have been criticising the government’s decision  stating it violated people’s constitutional rights , but many have shown support on social media stating the government was right to ban Tiktok. Beyond the demonstration in  Maitighar Mandala  on Monday, there appears to be minimal opposition to the ban. The evident support from the majority suggests that the morale of the ministers has likely experienced a boost. Openness has long been a hallmark and valuable asset of Nepali society. The  104-year-old autocratic Rana regime  and the  30-year-old panchayat system  were dismantled due to the citizens’ yearning for freedom. This desire for freedom was evident in historical movements, such as the  2005/06 protests , where people took to the streets against pro-autocracy forces and those threatening freedom. This is why, imposing a ban on TikTok appears to be unreasonable in a country with a  republican system of government , where controlling any means of expression is not conceivable. Social point of view Sociologist Dipesh Ghimire suggests examining the demographics of those supporting the decision to ban TikTok.  “There is a noticeable trend where men tend to favour the government’s decision, while women appear to be against it,” Ghimire told Onlinekhabar. “The men have developed a perception that TikTok has led to an increase in vulgarity, and some believe it is appropriate to regulate it.” Sociologist Ghimire’s argument holds weight, especially when considering the data on TikTok usage. The platform boasts a substantial number of female users. This is opposite to the the broader context of social media use which is dominated by men. For instance, on Facebook, which has around 3 billion active users, 56.5 per cent are male, while only 43.5 per cent are female. Conversely, TikTok exhibits a contrasting trend, with 55.3 per cent of its users being female and 44.7 per cent male. As outlined in an  article related to TikTok , the primary factor contributing to the platform’s high number of female users is its content accessibility. Unlike other social media platforms that rely on friend or follower connections, TikTok’s algorithm is interest-based. This design allows the stories shared by women on TikTok to easily reach a broad audience, resulting in a larger female user base. The most popular category or genre on TikTok is dance. Influencers create choreography using popular songs, inspiring people worldwide to follow suit. From professional dancers to everyday individuals, thousands of videos in this category are uploaded daily. Anthropologist Shyamu Thapa Magar highlights that TikTok’s prevalence among female users in Nepal is due to the convenience it provides.  “Men have been expressing themselves for years. However, TikTok has provided women with the facility to easily express their opinions and showcase their talents,” she says suggesting that working women are using TikTok as a platform to express their concealed desires. TikTok ban: Assessing the impact on Nepal’s democratic values The breach of freedom boundaries in the pursuit of creating videos and gaining viewership is evident, not only on TikTok but also on platforms like Facebook or YouTube with features like reels. Videos of this nature have found a significant presence on various social media platforms. However, a prevalent belief is that TikTok, in particular, has led to family breakdowns and an increase in perceived vulgarity, a viewpoint supported by many. Magar argues that the perception that vulgarity has entered through TikTok is rooted in the psychology of a male-dominated society. “You hear the men’s opinion you realise how worried they are about women who use TikTok. This is because they have not been able to control a woman’s body,” says Magar. However, she believes that the decision to ban may have been welcomed after TikTok breached the established ‘ethics’ boundaries over the years. Observing TikTok, one can witness young women from distant parts of Nepal and abroad expressing themselves freely through dance and speech. It can be assumed that the government and society’s reluctance to embrace such freedom is reflected in their language. “TikTok gave young women a space to express themselves. The men don’t like that,” says Magar. Sociologist Ghimire also contends that TikTok has presented a challenge to the facade of Nepali society. “Nepali society is contradictory and deceptive. It claims to be one thing, but behind closed doors, it is something else. It doesn’t show openly, but if you observe closely, you will see the same things happening. It claims to be straightforward, but if you question it in our own lives, it becomes an exception,” he says. “For a long time, our society has been running on the basis of deception.” However, he contends that the narrative of increased vulgarity in society due to TikTok is gaining traction, as it has dismantled the facade of Nepali society, a facade indirectly supported by major political parties. A common enemy of the parties There is also a political rationale behind the widespread support for the decision to ban TikTok. Successive governments have struggled to fulfil their promises, leading to an ongoing economic crisis and a significant outflow of people from the country. Whether for educational pursuits or employment opportunities, Nepalis have been departing the country in large numbers for years. Now, the reality has become evident for everyone to witness. The current situation has reached a point where even individuals who initially expressed their commitment to residing in Nepal are reconsidering their decision, leading to widespread disappointment among the general populace.  Naturally, this frustration extends into the political system and those in governance. Social media, consistently amplifying popular trends, plays a role in making these sentiments go viral. Even those who are against the current political system have used social media in an institutional form. Durga Prasai has spread rumours through social media. TikTok has become the most influential medium to spread the rumours spread by Prasai who once used to be in league with the leaders. If someone attacks the freedom of others to use the value of their freedom, it is not acceptable. Therefore, Prasai should either prove the accusations against the political leadership or face legal action. It cannot be discounted as freedom of expression. However, the current legislation may be inadequate for addressing these concerns, as laws were crafted in the absence of prominent social media platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter. Therefore, the need for new legislation is apparent. On November 9, the  government endorsed directives to regulate social media  use and provided preliminary approval to introduce a bill in this regard. Despite that, the government strangely have decided to ban TikTok rather than regulate it. “There is a directive to regulate social media, and we are in the process of crafting a law,” said Prakash Jwala, the minister for the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport.  He clarified that the government does not intend to control all social media but is taking this step to ensure the regulation of social media, and the decision to ban TikTok is part of that regulatory effort. Major political parties have expressed support for the government’s decision. Within the ruling coalition, besides Nepali Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma, leader Shekhar Koirala and others are in favour of banning TikTok. Notably, the main opposition UML did not register any protests against the decision. In a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on November 7, KP Sharma Oli, the leader of the opposition party and a supporter of the 12-point agreement, not only advocated for a ban on TikTok but also expressed his readiness to publicly support such a decision if the government chose to implement it. President of the Nepali Congress, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has also silently agreed to this. Sociologist Ghimire says that except for a few political leaders, the majority of the leaders have the mentality that they can control their existing challengers if they can control TikTok. Apart from the senior leaders of major parties, cadres and other political figures also support the ban on TikTok. According to  Search Engine Journal , there are 4.8 billion social media users globally. On average, a user engages with six or more social networks each month, dedicating approximately two hours and 24 minutes daily. Notably, TikTok captures a significant portion of users’ time, with an average monthly usage of 31 hours and 32 minutes per user. The increasing addiction to TikTok within families has led ordinary individuals to support the ban. A leader, advocating for the incorporation of TikTok through legislation instead of a ban, notes that while teenagers express frustration, others who are affected alongside users have not opposed the ban.",political

Sher Bahadur Deuba’s lone decisions leave other party members answering the consequences,"Nepali Congress  President Sher Bahadur Deuba is often observed as a reserved speaker who listens attentively. However, his tendency to make independent decisions contradicts the perception that he is a careful listener, creating a conflict in his actions. Examining Sher Bahadur Deuba’s most recent decisions provides a basis for evaluation. TikTok ban Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, along with Deuba and the chair of the main opposition party UML, KP Sharma Oli, played a key role in creating an  environment to ban TikTok . The need to regulate the widespread vulgarity on TikTok was deemed imperative. However, Deuba did not engage in consultations regarding this decision with the party members. Consequently, two General Secretaries,  Gagan Thapa and Biswa Prakash Sharma , along with many other leaders of the Nepali Congress, opposed the approval provided by the party president. Consequently, his stance did not align with the institutional opinion of the Nepali Congress. On November 7, Prime Minister Dahal called a meeting with the then-seven parties and the Maoists (12-member group), who were actively spearheading the peace process. Accompanied by Krishna Prasad Sitaula, a key figure in the peace process, Deuba attended the meeting at Singhadarbar. On that very day, the government announced the TikTok ban, and notably, Deuba did not voice any objections to this decision. Why? It can be said that Sher Bahadur Deuba has not been a fan of the platform that has vilified him and his family over the past year.  In April, Deuba acknowledged that the party faced an escalating wave of attacks on social media. It was said that organised social media assaults hindered the party and its leaders from  securing victory in Tanahun-1 . Despite existing perceptions within the party regarding social media, Deuba’s independent decision to ban TikTok carries particular significance for the Nepali Congress. Deuba provided a ‘green signal’ to the government for the TikTok ban without deeming it necessary to discuss the matter within the party or convene a meeting of officials. Contrary to PM Dahal’s assertion that all parties supported the decision, Gagan Thapa promptly contradicted the Prime Minister’s statement a day after the TikTok ban was implemented. Thapa questioned the Prime Minister through social media, asking, “Where and when has there been a discussion within our party Nepali Congress? When and where has there been consensus? Who and how was the consensus made?” Sher Bahadur Deuba rarely includes General Secretaries Thapa and Sharma in discussions with PM Dahal, and they claim that any agreement between the Prime Minister and Deuba only becomes evident through media disclosure. Thapa says that supporting a decision made without informing or discussing it within the party is not feasible. In a cautionary tone directed at Deuba, Thapa says, “The party is not the private company of the party president, any of his opinion should not be a party’s opinion, internal discussions should take place within the party.” Thapa stated that he met with PM Dahal and inquired about the rationale behind considering the discussion at Baluwatar as an alliance meeting before recent decisions, including the TikTok ban. The party’s leaders have voiced their opposition to Deuba’s actions since he adopted the policy of abstaining from the decision-making process. Ambassador appointments The government’s choice to establish a Nepali embassy in Portugal and nominate Sunil Nepal as the ambassador was made on November 9. Nepal has a close association with Nepali Congress politician Dr Shashank Koirala. Party leaders have indicated that there was no internal discussion within the party regarding the appointment of the ambassador. This is consistent with the observation that Sher Bahadur Deuba has not been following the institutional system for making appointments. Undemocratic decision-making within the party As per the Nepali Congress’s statute, the president exerts “unlimited” power. However, party leaders argue that despite various positions within the Central Committee, internal cohesion has not been fortified when all authority is concentrated in the hands of the president. Critics contend that the  party has weakened due to the perceived misuse of powers  by Sher Bahadur Deuba. They point to instances where Deuba has overlooked other perspectives in decisions related to central to provincial ministers, nominations for fraternal organisation presidents, appointments of parliamentary committee chairpersons, and the expansion of the central committee. Congress leaders are commenting that not having internal discussions on some issues before making a decision has had a long-term impact on the party. There is an understanding within the party that due to the lack of internal discussion in the decision-making process, the party has to suffer. Central member Shyam Ghimire says there is a problem in the party due to a lack of internal discussion on serious issues.  “We are not even able to give clear opinions on issues”, says Ghimire, “It is my understanding that the lack of discussion has led to serious problems.” Gagan Thapa vehemently objected to Deuba’s operational approach, questioning, “Shouldn’t there be a discussion about the individuals he wishes to appoint? For the party’s well-being, there should be a discourse on the suitability of the individuals he intends to appoint.” According to other leaders, Sher Bahadur Deuba appears unwilling to engage in discussions about the individuals he endorses for various responsibilities within the party. Nominating central members solely and selecting ministers on a whim The statute of the Nepali Congress has given the party president the right to nominate 33 central members. But, Sher Bahadur Deuba has appointed five people to the central committee, a move that goes against the party’s regulations. According to the party’s rules, individuals who face defeat in the inter-party election at the lower level are not eligible for inclusion in the central committee. Arjun Prasad Joshi, Bharat Shah, Kiran Raj Sharma, Laxmi Khatiwada and Ganga Shahi, who lost during the last convention, were made central members by Deuba. The leaders sought the president’s answer by showing the provisions of the law. Deuba did not care and went ahead anyway. The party leadership has been resistant to endorsing the president’s unilateral approach in significant decisions. Concerns have been raised about the damage incurred by the party as a result of not adhering to the constitutional framework and rejecting the collective leadership system. Leaders within the party express the sentiment that Sher Bahadur Deuba appears disconnected from the concerns and grievances of ordinary citizens. Consequently, other leaders at the Nepali Congress find themselves compelled to respond to his decisions, shaping the fate of the party. “The president does not care what the citizens are saying about the decisions he has made, but we do,” says a member of the Nepali Congress on the condition of anonymity. “He takes the decision but it is we who have to be answerable to the public. We don’t think it is fair.” This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
What prompts the govt to be cautious in the face of the UML Youth Wing and Durga Prasai’s demonstrations in Kathmandu?,"CPN-UML’s sister organisation, the National Youth Federation Nepal (youth wing), and Durga Prasain-led Rastra, Rastriyata, Dharma-Sanskriti, and Nagarik Bachau Andolan (a citizen’s movement for the protection of nation, nationalism, religion, and culture) have declared they will stage a one-day demonstration of power on November 23. This announcement by Mahesh Basnet and Durga Prasai has put the government on edge with fears of a clash between the two groups. Initially, both parties said that they would hold a program at Maitighar Mandala, but the District Administration Office, Kathmandu  had other plans . Kathmandu’s Chief District Officer,  Jitendra Basnet,  fearing a clash barred protests from being staged at the Maitighar and Baneshwor area for a month. That has led the two groups to hold their demonstrations in separate places. During the discussions at various stages, Jitendra Basnet said that not only would Maitighar Mandala be off-limits, but any concurrent events by two parties in Kathmandu at the same place, time, and date would not be approved. Instead, they were advised to opt for different areas such as Tinkune, Machhapokhari, Narayanchaur etc.  Subsequently, the Mahesh Basnet-led youth wing selected Tinkune for its program, while the group led by Durga Prasai opted for Balkhu.  Former DIG of Nepal Police, Hemant Malla Thakuri, says that the administration has taken such a decision to prevent any untoward incident as both Mahesh Banset and Durgra Prasai and their followers have been publicly targeting each other over the past few months.  “In the past, there have been instances of unpleasant incidents when we did not take precautions. Now the administration is doing so as it does not want any riots in the city,” he says. However, on Tuesday, both Kathmandu and Lalitpur took extra measures by  banning protests in the vicinity of the UN House and the Minister’s quarters  along with the residences of the President and Prime Minister. Mahesh Basnet and Durga Prasai’s bitterness Controversial businessman Durga Prasai was once close to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. He claims to have given refuge to the Maoists during the People’s War. The proof of this was when Dahal, when he was prime minister in 2016, insisted on giving affiliation of Prasai’s medical college B&C Hospital. But, thanks to Dr Govinda KC, that plan did not materialise. Later, when  UML and Maoists merged to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) , Prasai also became close to KP Sharma Oli. Prasai even joined the UML and also became its central member.  However, Oli got angry with Prasai when he started conducting a campaign for the restoration of the monarchy. He was subsequently  expelled from the UML  in February. It appears that the expulsion has soured Prasai’s feelings, as he has been speaking negatively about Oli ever since. This has not been well-received by UML leader Mahesh Basnet. On October 9, Prasai was smeared with black soot by members of the UML youth wing in Kathmandu. This was ironic as Prasai had been stating the bankers and local sharks needed to be smeared with black soot. It was Mahesh Banset’s turn to face the music as Prasai’s followers tried to disrupt a programme he was due to attend in Jhapa. Vehicles were vandalised but Prasai’s followers never got close to Mahesh Basnet. While the bitterness between Mahesh Basnet and Durga Prasai continued, both of them continued to speak against each other at public forums. While garnering public support by expressing his stance against loans, microfinance, and the plight of  loan shark victims , Prasai declared his intention to demonstrate his power in Kathmandu starting from October 24. He outlined programs with the assertion of ‘changing the system.’ In the statement issued on November 19 on behalf of his group, it is said that the ‘Peaceful Civil Liberation Movement’ will be started from November 23. Prasai has called upon Hindu organisations, activists and even Nepalis living abroad to participate in the demonstration. At the same time, the UML youth wing has also announced that it will stage a demonstration against corruption and anarchy. On Saturday, UML president KP Sharma Oli also said that this is the party’s program. However, some observers have remarked that the UML has become entangled in the animosity between Mahesh Basnet and Durga Prasai. When asked why the UML youth wing was staging a protest on the same day as Durga Prasai, Mahesh Basnet said they planned the protest two months in advance. With both parties unwilling to yield, the protest is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Kathmandu, and it is anticipated to disrupt traffic. Fearing potential disruptions, some schools have decided to shut down altogether. Kathmandu is on high alert After efforts to ask Mahesh Basnet and Durga Prasai to stage their protests on different days proved unsuccessful, the Home Ministry conducted joint meetings involving all security agencies for security preparations.  On November 17, Prime Minister Dahal personally convened a briefing with the heads of the security agencies. During the briefing, he expressed interest in Prasai and the youth wing’s programme and directed the strengthening of the security system. According to sources, following that, the Home Ministry engaged in discussions with officials from various security agencies. On November 17, Home Secretary Dinesh Bhattarai held a three-hour discussion with the three chief district officers and the security chiefs of the valley. Security sources have reported that Prasai appointed contact persons at 86 locations, announcing plans to mobilise people from all over the country. “There is information that they have been given the responsibility to bring people in the bus”, a source from the Home Ministry told Onlinekhabar on the condition of anonymity. “We think there is a chance of over 10,000 gathering in Kathmandu.” The security apparatus has a report that rooms have been booked in some hotels in the valley in the name of Prasai’s campaign till Tuesday night. Prasai is planning to gather a large number of people with the conclusion that his future will be determined by this demonstration. According to sources from the National Research Department, recent programs organised by Prasai in Kathmandu had no more than 300 attendees. However, the Department predicts the number may increase, as disaffected groups from political parties can potentially mobilise people from various districts to join the demonstration in Kathmandu. “On top of that, the area chosen by Prasai is also a place where there is high movement of locals, it increases the crowd”, the source said. Investigation suggests that security agencies need to remain vigilant, given the estimation of the presence of extremist groups in Prasai’s demonstration advocating for a Hindu nation and monarchy. Prasai has also invited Hindu organisations to participate in the demonstration. In light of this, security for November 23 is being coordinated by establishing a joint operation centre, with the presence of an officer from the Directorate General of Military Intelligence (DGMI) of the Nepal Army. It will also have a team from the Armed Police Force and the National Investigation Department. Officials say that since Prasai has announced that its program will continue after November 23, they have to prepare accordingly. Kathmandu Police Chief SSP Khatri says that the security system has tightened the checks even at the major entry points.",political

Unclear definitions in new social media directive raise concerns of potential ambiguity and challenges ahead,"The government is implementing the Social Media Management Guidelines 2023, which effectively prohibits the creation of fake IDs, pages, or groups with the intent of using anonymous or false identities. Furthermore, the social media directive serves dual purposes—regulating the use of social networks and promoting self-regulation among both platform operators and users. This includes manipulating images through animation or montages, and any derogatory troll posts that distort original pictures. Also, it has targeted the unauthorised sharing or commenting on others’ content and deceptive calls. Netra Prasad Subedi, joint secretary and spokesperson at the  Ministry of Communication and Information Technology , highlighted that these guidelines aim to curb illicit activities across various platforms like Facebook,  TikTok , Twitter, Viber, Pinterest, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, WeChat, and other online groups and blogs allowing idea exchange and content dissemination. Despite this, experts, including cyber law advocate Santosh Sigdel, have criticised the government for not providing adequate explanations behind the social media directive. They suggest that the directives might aim to obscure criticism and suppress certain social media movements. While the guidelines address fake IDs, pages, and groups, many aspects remain unclear, they argue. “International law doesn’t mandate social media platforms to register to operate. If individuals with shared views unite through a page or group, how can such gatherings be labelled as fake? Will groups like ‘No Not Again’ active during the latest elections, ‘Enough is Enough’ during the pandemic, or various pages and groups dedicated to social causes no longer be permitted to operate?” he questions. Can the government regulate? The social media directive prohibits publishing and broadcasting of content—words, audio, visuals, images, and trolls—that disrupt social harmony and tolerance. It also prohibits promoting activities already banned by law. The government now also puts regulations on ‘hate speech’ which is defined as any content—sounds, words, pictures, videos, trolls—that could lead to negative consequences like inciting violence or disrupting social harmony through posts, shares, or comments. Subedi further remarks that the government might misuse these ambiguous provisions in the guidelines by interpreting them to suit their agenda. “The possibility of freedom of expression being marred cannot be ruled out.” In the social media directive, it is forbidden to publish or broadcast a person’s picture altered through animation, montages, or other digital media techniques. Furthermore, it specifies that aside from public matters, photos/videos depicting private affairs cannot be taken, edited, published, or broadcasted without consent.  Additionally, the use of obscene words, pictures, audio, video animations, publications, broadcasts, or comments in support of such content is prohibited. Not just posting, but advertising, duplicating and sharing them are also explicitly prohibited in the social media directive. “What defines obscenity? What constitutes distorting an image? Are caricatures completely disallowed? Trolling? Memes?” questions Sigdel.  Sigdel expresses concerns that the guidelines, which restrict the digital creation of even cartoons—a form traditionally associated with freedom of expression—go beyond parliamentary norms. He cautions that such guidelines imposed by external sources increase the risk of misinterpretation, trolling, or the proliferation of ‘meme culture.’ Expressions of hatred directed at protected categories such as individuals, communities, genders, religions, ages, professions, and other legally safeguarded groups are also deemed unacceptable according to the directive. This also applies to issues like child labour, human trafficking, polygamy, child marriage, and caste-based untouchability. Sigdel’s analysis suggests that the government’s actions may surpass the intended impacts outlined in the guidelines, primarily due to the vague provisions. He specifically notes the social media directive’s attempt to regulate comments but points out a lack of clarity regarding the responsibility for monitoring and addressing comments on others’ pages and posts. User’s responsibilities The social media directive lays out specific responsibilities for social media users, stressing the avoidance of any communication that could adversely affect Nepal’s sovereignty, geographical integrity, national security, unity, independence, self-respect, national interests, or relationships between federal units. The social media directive guidelines commendably address content harmful to children, rightly discouraging activities like child sexual exploitation, abuse, and prostitution. It also prohibits promoting drug use, trafficking, gambling, or any related acts, alongside publishing terrorism-related content. Additionally, it forbids actions that breach personal privacy, like hacking IDs or engaging in phishing via social media. Moreover, the social media directive explicitly states that certain actions—disseminating false information, sharing misleading or disinformation, publishing hacked information, using technology for intimidation, and spreading false information—are not classified as cyberbullying. Users are strongly advised against participating in or inciting hatred, malice, or contempt based on class, caste, religion, region, or communal affiliations. It stats that it is the individual’s responsibility to abstain from posting, sharing, tagging, liking or commenting, subscribing to, live broadcasts, and hashtagging such topics that disrupt social harmony and go against the  new directive . Mandatory registration With the new social media directive, individuals, companies, or organisations running social media platforms in Nepal will now also be required to register with the ministry. The ministry will provide a public notice detailing the registration procedure for the same.  The government has categorised social networking platforms in Nepal into two groups based on user numbers. Those with fewer than 100,000 users are considered small social media platforms, while those surpassing 100,000 users are classified as large social media platforms. Social platforms that were operational before the directive must apply for listing with the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology within three months of the social media directive’s introduction. Official recognition in Nepal for these platforms will only be granted after the government compiles the list. The guidelines explicitly state that unlisted social media platforms may be barred from operating in Nepal. However, it is clarified that this regulation will not impact social media platforms dedicated solely to civic education and social empowerment. Moreover, operators of listed social media platforms must update their information every three years to maintain their authorised status. Any changes in the contact centre’s address or the officer handling complaints need to be notified to the Social Network Management Unit. Addressing the grievances Social media is also not alien to the grievances. To address that, the social media directive says that operators of social media platforms are mandated to set up a contact centre within Nepal. This centre should include a designated officer stationed in Nepal to manage complaints and another overseeing self-regulation. For social network platform operators without an existing Nepal office, the guidelines dictate the establishment of an office or appointment of a contact person within three months. The government, meanwhile, also intends to create a ‘Social Network Management Unit’ within the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to handle complaints lodged by social media platform operators or their contact offices.  This unit will address unresolved grievances or issues not handled by relevant agencies under existing laws. When filing a complaint about social media usage, the complainant will be required to submit a screenshot of the content involving instances of deception, harassment, or abuse. The unit will promptly issue written notices to the concerned social media platform’s contact centre for the removal of content that contradicts the guidelines. If a person in a position of public accountability breaches the guidelines, the unit will notify the relevant agency or authority, in writing. Moreover, the unit will organise meetings involving relevant agencies to establish a systematic approach to the use and regulation of social media. It will advocate for legal frameworks and promote best practices for responsible social media use. Additionally, under the social media directive, the unit will facilitate institutionalised studies, research, and dialogue in this domain. Social media platforms must also create algorithms and adopt measures within their networks to prevent the dissemination of content violating existing laws. Moreover, the social media directive mandates platform operators to uphold essential security standards to protect users’ private information and refrain from making it public or using it for other purposes. The platforms’ contact centres in Nepal must identify and take action against content on social media that violates the guidelines. They are required to deactivate or remove prohibited content for a specified period or permanently. According to the guidelines, upon receiving complaints about inappropriate content on social media, platforms must promptly identify and remove it within 24 hours.  Furthermore, they must inform about their activities to the Social Media Management Unit and Department of Information and Broadcasting, Advertising Board, Press Council of Nepal, and Nepal Telecommunication Authority. It also requires fact-checking and compliance with the ‘ Santa Clara Principle ‘ for regulating social media. Additionally, the social media directive specifies the facilitation of financial transactions through the banking system within social media operations. Experts note that the guidelines, derived from Section 79 of the Electronic Transactions Act ( 2008 ), provide a legal basis for imposing penalties for violations, as outlined by the Act and its regulations. Advocate Sigdel raises concerns about the social media directive guidelines lacking legal clarity on social media use, potentially creating unresolved issues exploited by the government.  “Subjects not addressed in the current law are also encompassed in the directive. This inclusion poses a risk as it might be utilised to suppress discontent that could arise against the government or political parties and their social media activities in the future,” he says issuing a warning.",political
National Assembly election planned for January 2024 with 20 members retiring in March,"Kathmandu, November 21 Twenty members of the  National Assembly , the Upper House of the Parliament, including Chair Ganesh Prasad Timilsina are retiring on March 4, 2024. The National Assembly has 59 members and the six-year term of one-third of them is ending on March 4. They belong to the group of members whose term was determined through a draw for the first time after the formation of the Assembly in 2017. Often referred to as the Elders’ House, the Upper House plays a crucial role in the legislative process by contributing to the enrichment of bills and legislation. It is a forum for in-depth discussions and provides valuable feedback, suggestions, and advice on the decisions put forth by the House of Representatives.  While some critics argue that the  National Assembly has become overshadowed  by the House of Representatives, it has, at times, conveyed messages to the House of Representatives, urging a review of certain significant bills. The term of all the National Assembly members, whose tenure was determined for two, four and six years through a lottery system for the first time after the formation of the Assembly in 2017, is expiring on March 4, 2024.  Among them, eight belong to the CPN (UML), four to the Nepali Congress, three to the Maoist Centre, two to Unified Socialist and one to JSP while one each is an independent and nominated.",political
"Intelligence, democracy and today’s Nepali Congress","Who possesses intellect? This is a topic that warrants debate in today’s world. Furthermore, intelligence and conscience serve as the tools that maintain a balanced political landscape. If these tools are not wielded properly, they have the potential to cause unforeseen accidents. Utilising the knowledge systematically acquired through life experiences for the betterment of society is the fundamental goal of intelligence. I prefer not to delve too deeply into the definition and explanation of democracy; my perspective on democracy is more spiritual than explanatory. I believe that it is an advanced democratic practice for every person to express democracy in their behaviour. My concern is how  the Nepali Congress,  being a major democratic force in Nepal works for democracy in its intellectual, political and democratic practice.  A comparison, the early days and now The Nepali Congress is a party with a rich history in the country, rooted in its own original principles and beliefs. The early movement initiated by the Nepali Congress was closely linked with the intellectual and literary movements in Nepal. However, the current political trajectory, marked by trends of anarchy and disillusionment among leaders within the Nepali Congress, appears to deviate from the party’s foundational principles and beliefs. Discussions and debates within the party are decreasing day by day. There is a notable absence of questioning cadres within the party, leading to an influx of conformist members. Consequently, this trend is giving rise to distinct classes within the democratic party. Instead of focusing on updating the party’s policies and principles to align with the current global environment, there is a discernible shift toward hypocritical tendencies within the party. Even though the Nepali Congress is now in a situation where the economic policies put forward by  BP Koirala  can be easily implemented, the attention of the leaders has not been directed towards them. Are the present local governments of the Nepali Congress aligning with the economic development principles advocated by BP Koirala? Is the Nepali Congress positioning itself in the political arena as a historical necessity, representing the independent spirit of the Nepali people who were historically exploited by the feudal system? These are questions that should be discussed in depth within the Nepali Congress. The problem The reason for all these problems created within the party is the ideological deviation and  factionalism created within the party . It is evident that issues, such as different factions attempting to steer the democratic party according to their own preferences, are becoming ingrained in the current Nepali Congress. Although the party embraces the path of socialism, it seems that there is a drought within the party on how to adopt the path of socialism shown by the BP in the current era and how to build a more advanced socialist state system. The consciousness of what we are, what we are not, and why we are different from the communists is not seen even in the latest generation of Nepali Congress. It has not happened even from the schooling leaders, which indicates that the party is still on the path of the Mahabharatian political system rather than the direction of scientific politics. Politically, all parties in the country proclaim to oppose corruption. However, the party that asserts itself as entirely democratic, declares its role as the guardian of diverse political movements in Nepal, and advocates policies aimed at fostering societal brotherhood is facing serious scrutiny. The  involvement of party cadres in corruption , coupled with leaders actively shielding corrupt practices, raises significant questions about the state of politics today. And there are signs that the people are  looking for an alternative . The various electoral alliances and alliances formed due to the vested interests of some individuals and groups do not seem to be healthy for the Nepali Congress in the long term. Moreover, such unnatural alliances created against the constitution and principles of the party create a situation of deviation and confusion among the general workers of the party in the long term. The democratic movement of the Nepali Congress has now turned into a campaign because the political movement has already been completed at one stage. However, it may not have been felt so much at the public level. In the political landscape of Nepal, the Nepali Congress is a party that has been granted numerous opportunities by the people for improvement. With the increasing potential for alternative politics, it appears that the Nepali Congress faces a significant challenge in enhancing itself over the next three years. Since the Communists of Nepal are becoming more bourgeois, the communist movement established a new structure through class struggle. But history has proven that the communists are falling in the world because the new structure that is built becomes feudal and authoritarian. The communist movement in Nepal is also in the same condition now. In this situation, the Nepali Congress can gather a lot of trust from the people and establish itself as a stable political force. The Nepali Congress has no more options. So, now Nepali Congress should start a new democratic revolution towards production, accelerate the construction of national capital, and move forward in the direction of advanced socialism. Even though the Nepali Congress is a party of scholars and decent people, this belief is still alive somewhere. Once again, the Nepali Congress can prove this point.",political
Supreme Court hearing on TikTok ban postponed,"Kathmandu, November 20 The preliminary court hearing set for Monday at the  Supreme Court  in response to the government’s decision to ban  TikTok  has been postponed. Ten writ petitions challenging the TikTok ban were submitted to the Supreme Court and allocated to a single bench presided over by Justice Kumar Chudal. Due to other priority cases, this matter did not take precedence today. The writs were also assigned to a divisional bench comprising Justices Chudal and Nahakul Subedi. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to hear the writ petitions. On November 13, the  Council of Ministers banned TikTok  for disrupting social harmony. The government’s decision came under criticism for being perceived as against freedom of expression. On November 17, lawyers and businesspersons  filed writ petitions at the Supreme Court  challenging the government’s decision.",political
Voices unheard: The struggle for gender justice among conflict-affected women,"After 17 years of a  peace process , the lingering legacy of political violence continues to impact women in Nepal. Unfortunately, the nation has struggled to comprehend and effectively address the specific needs of  women in the post-conflict era . This failure has impeded transformative change and progress in the country. The persistence of underlying structural violence has hindered societies from rebuilding socially and psychologically. Unfortunately, gendered communal healing and community reconciliation are notably absent from mainstream peace discourse, posing a regrettable obstacle to comprehensive recovery. Dilemma on gender justice The prolonged peace process has given rise to new conflicts,  exacerbating the subjugation of women  who continue to bear the  impacts of the armed conflict . The agency women built during the armed conflict is now eroding due to the myriad of injustices- political, economic, cultural, social and psychological –imposed by a patriarchal society. The dilemma on gender justice is vividly seen at the state and political level of peacebuilding. Male leaders in positions of power have failed to recognise the  multi-layered injustices faced by women . This failure is often attributed to the fact that these power-holders operate within an environment conducive to their authority, making it difficult for them to fully perceive the injustices experienced by other, more vulnerable individuals. This hindrance to structural change in the so-called peace process is perpetuating the social and cultural misery experienced by conflict-affected women. Moreover, these challenges are adversely impacting subsequent generations. The interconnectedness of individuals and our undeniable co-existence emphasises the importance of acknowledging these facts, as ignoring them may result in long-term repercussions. Unfortunately, non-affected communities of the conflict also have not shown sufficient observance or taken initiatives with a sense of accountability to alleviate the social and cultural misery faced by conflict-affected women. Subsequently, it seems like conflict-affected women are living even worse situations in this post-conflict situation than, they were in the time of conflict which is marginalising them in many forms. The state’s failure to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the context and allocate resources for the well-being of women is evident. Absent from mainstream peace discourse The so-called transitional justice process, often marked by rhetoric, requires a re-envisioning of its modality of implementation with an amendment to its act. The complex web of relationships between the institutions, policies and the affected communities is often overlooked. This results in policies directly impacting the lives of the conflict-affected communities without adequate consideration. In contrast, they are the main stakeholders of the transitional justice process. Now, many conflict-affected women are in their growing age and questioning how the government will compensate for their lost moments and address their physical, bodily and mental losses. Additionally, they are expressing there is no sense in receiving compensation/reparation for the harm they suffered when they are not alive as many have already lost their lives.  Recently, in the tragic incidents of  earthquakes in Jajaorkt and Rukum West , women awaiting justice for the conflict have lost their lives. This incident also calls for urgent, timely and sensitive responses to the challenges faced by conflict-affected women. There is a pressing need for a fundamental shift in the arrogance and fear among the political parties and state, along with increased accountability for delaying the transitional justice process and contributing to the emergence of different forms of conflict.  While international attention is often focused on larger conflicts in other regions, securing support from national and international communities is crucial to advancing justice, human security and peace dividend for Nepal’s conflict-affected women.",political
TikTok ban in Nepal: 4 points to understand about the controversial decision,"On November 13, the  Council of Ministers decided to impose the TikTok ban in Nepal  citing its negative impact on social harmony and the social environment. Since the enforcement of the TikTok ban in Nepal, which coincided with the start of the Tihar holiday, 10 writ petitions have been lodged challenging the government’s move.  The administrative department of the  Supreme Court  has grouped all these writ petitions about the TikTok ban in Nepal and set the preliminary hearing for Monday (November 20). Assault on freedom of expression Legal experts and advocates for digital rights have contended that the government’s decision on the TikTok ban in Nepal is unconstitutional and are demanding its reversal. They have challenged the decision of the TikTok ban in Nepal, raising four fundamental issues and questioning the government’s rationale. All the writ petitioners have asserted that the  government’s action  is an assault on the fundamental right to freedom of thought and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. “If the medium of communication of ideas and opinions is restricted, freedom of thought and expression may prove to be meaningless. No citizen can be deprived of the beneficial and democratic use of technology,” senior advocate Dinesh Tripathi states in the petition he presented to the court. Legal experts also argue that those responsible for misusing the platform should be held accountable, without taking action against the entire platform, based on the principle that the remedy should not be more risky than the condition itself. Occult decision Legal practitioners have criticised this reasoning of the TikTok ban in Nepal as subjective, vague, and abstract. They also say the claim that TikTok ‘deteriorates social harmony’ lacks factual and objective details, and argue that the government’s decision to ban the platform based on that is subjective, vague, and abstract. “Even if they attempt to create commentary around the social media ban stating that it undermines social harmony through deceitful means, the government’s intention is clear in this regard,” cites the writ petition. The petitions have sought the annulment of the decision of the TikTok ban in Nepal.  The writ petition reads, “In any democratic society, the expression of citizens cannot be restricted based on self-interest and prejudice.” Advocate Sunil Ranjan Singh has argued that the positive aspects of TikTok were overlooked, and the negative aspects were interpreted in a biased manner to justify the ban.  “The decision to completely shut down TikTok, solely based on its perceived negative effects, violates the constitutional and legal rights of citizens related to expression, information, and other rights,” Singh states in the petition. Police the content, not the medium Article 17 of the Constitution contains a provision concerning the right to communication, underscoring the absence of prior restrictions on disseminating content and information through any medium, encompassing electronic, broadcasting, and print. Since the provision says ‘any medium’ this extends to the usage of applications like TikTok. Within the constitution itself, specific activities are identified as exceptions to the freedom of thought and expression. There is a provision allowing the enactment of laws to prohibit activities that disrupt the country’s sovereignty, geographical integrity, religious sentiments, caste discrimination, or untouchability. Advocate Swagat Nepal in a writ petition he filed states, “Reasonable restrictions can be placed on text or content. The constitution does not anticipate the prohibition of the mediums or platforms used for publishing or transmitting the content. The law does not have the provision for banning the modes of publication, broadcasting, display, or dissemination of media content.'” If the content breaches the law, the Constitution does not envision a ban on the medium — like the TikTok ban; rather, only the objectionable content, the petitioners have argued in the writ. In a separate writ petition, there is a plea for the nullification of the decision and insists on holding the user responsible rather than restricting the medium itself arbitrarily to make it accountable. Lacking legal basis According to legal experts, social media platforms like TikTok brought to light the government’s and public officials’ inappropriate actions, thereby exposing these activities to the general public. Legal practitioners say that a considerable number of users have been a ‘problem’ for the government, and major parties have made this decision out of fear. They argue that civil liberties and rights cannot be revoked or curtailed by the government for its convenience. The government has not yet disclosed the specifics of the legal justification and grounds for the decision of the TikTok ban in Nepal. The  Nepal Telecommunication Authority  has issued directives based on Section 15 of the Telecommunications Act, 1997.  The section cites “The Authority may, given the policy and guidelines of Government of Nepal, issue necessary orders or directives to the licensee and it shall be the duty of the concerned person to comply with such orders or directives.” But the writ petition argues that the TikTok ban in Nepal was enforced using legal provisions allowing instructions on any policy matter determined by the government.  “However using Section 15 of the Telecommunications Act cannot validate the unconstitutional decision made by the Council of Ministers.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Nepal’s long quest for transparent governance and development,"Nestled in the lap of the Himalayas, Nepal boasts a rich and diverse history that encompasses various dynasties, regimes, and political transitions. The nation’s political landscape has evolved significantly, from smaller fiefdoms governed by different dynasties to the era of unification under  Prithvi Narayan Shah .  This period was followed by a century of  Rana rule , the establishment of a monarchy, and, ultimately, the transition to a republic. Throughout these phases, Nepal has experienced dramatic shifts in its political structure. Amidst these transitions, a persistent issue has loomed large over the years: a lack of substantial, tangible development and transparent governance. Corruption: The root cause of hindrance Corruption is rampant  in Nepal, with opportunities for its existence in various aspects of life. From the  misuse of fuel coupons  meant for government officials to  human trafficking conducted under the guise of refugee assistance ,  corruption is deeply ingrained in the system . Numerous high-profile corruption cases have been swept under the rug, further perpetuating this vicious cycle. Corruption has been the pervasive issue that has plagued Nepal, and it remains the root cause of hindrance to development. The ethics and morality of the rulers have always been under suspicion and have shown a consistent decline over the years. Corruption scandals involving political leaders have become alarmingly common, eroding the trust of the public. The public sector, including government offices, has become notorious for corruption. Almost every service seems to come with a price tag, and it is exceptionally challenging to get things done without offering “under-the-table” payments. This culture of corruption has thrived due to the lack of accountability and transparent governance. Moreover, the complex governance structure within Nepal, given its relatively small size, often raises questions about the costs associated with maintaining it. The traditional approach to governance and the egos of political leaders have frequently led the country to lag behind, missing out on opportunities for development and growth. Unstable government and loss of the public’s faith Nepal has seen frequent  changes in government , resulting in political instability and a lack of proper governance. This inconsistency hampers the nation’s progress and leaves its citizens yearning for economic, social, and infrastructural development. In recent times, public sentiment towards established political leaders has declined. The electorate has started  looking for alternative options  to steer the country towards prosperity and development. The economy, infrastructure, and various development indices have been on a downward trajectory. From minor scams to major scandals, the government and other stakeholders often seem to overlook such issues, adding to the disillusionment of the people. Nepal faces a range of national and international issues, yet there appears to be a lack of concerted effort to address them. The country’s leaders seem preoccupied with internal politics, often neglecting crucial diplomatic and international relations that could aid in the nation’s growth. Brain drain and economic struggles Many educated youths have left Nepal to work in other countries, contributing to the brain drain phenomenon. The  nation’s fertile lands remain barren  due to a lack of agricultural activities, and ageing parents are often left to fend for themselves. Industries have struggled to survive, leading to economic stagnation and joblessness. Then, there is the erosion of ethics, morality, and humanity within Nepali society, which has reached concerning levels. Responsibility and accountability are often absent, contributing to leaders’ overall decline in trust and moral character. Nepal stands at a crossroads, and the decisions made in the coming years will shape the destiny of the nation. If corrective measures are not taken seriously and stringently, the next generation will have no choice but to inherit the problems that persist today. It is time for all stakeholders, including political leaders, civil society, and citizens, to introspect and work towards a brighter future for Nepal. History will remember the choices made in these crucial times. The need for transparent governance, ethical leadership, and a commitment to development and prosperity is paramount. It is the collective responsibility of all to ensure that Nepal moves forward on a path that reflects the aspirations and dreams of its people. The time for change and progress is now.",political

Landmark verdict in Yog Raj Dhakal’s case paves the way for victim-centred justice,"The notion that everyone deserves a second chance extends to our legal system, where prisoners can potentially be granted exemption based on their demonstrated good behaviour. The  Prisons Act of 1963  and the corresponding regulations have established clear criteria for this option, though it may not be extended to individuals convicted of particularly grave offences. For years, the country’s prison administrators, commonly known as jailers, have been granting the exemption to the inmates at their discretion. In doing so, the law has been misused to  serve the interests of political parties, leaders, and high-ranking officials. However, amidst the controversy surrounding  Yog Raj Dhakal ‘s (aka Regal) presidential pardon, the full bench of the  Supreme Court  expressed reservations about how the provision was used. This cast doubts on the process and decision-making within Nepal’s criminal justice system. As per a summary of the verdict issued on November 2, moving forward, the victim’s consent will be a requisite before pardoning a criminal. Moreover, upon a prisoner’s release, due consideration must be given to their social reintegration and compensation. This fundamentally implies that decisions regarding imprisonment can no longer be solely determined by prison officials or the prevailing political and administrative leadership. The bench led by Justice Ishwor Prasad Khatiwada, along with Sapna Pradhan Malla and Dr Kumar Chudal has expressed the view that the rights of victims and their entitlement to justice, as outlined in the Constitution of Nepal and similar laws, should be intricately linked to the consent of crime victims.  They stressed that the rights of victims of the crime, as outlined in  Article 21 of the Constitution , should not be overlooked or considered less significant when interpreting and applying Article 276 of the Constitution of Nepal or any other relevant Nepali laws.  Article 276 of the Constitution pertains to the reduction and remission of penalties and fines. Meanwhile, Article 21 addresses the rights of crime victims, affirming that “Crime victims have the right to seek justice, including social rehabilitation and compensation.” The Supreme Court has offered a fresh perspective that underscores the importance of not overlooking the role of the victim when prisoners are released from incarceration. Dr Rajit Bhakta Pradhanang, a professor of criminology, has commented that the Supreme Court’s ruling provides a significant interpretation in support of the victims and is likely to have a lasting impact. The new law Until now, only the duration of imprisonment and the conduct of the prisoners were taken into account when considering the exemption from imprisonment as part of the prisoners’ social rehabilitation. Once the prescribed period of incarceration was completed, the prison administration would readily label them as ‘well-behaved.’ However, now the presence of the victim has become mandatory. “Throughout the crime’s execution, there was substantial theoretical discourse emphasising the importance of not overlooking the victim’s role and the necessity to obtain the victim’s consent before granting concessions to the perpetrator,” he says. “The Act was formulated per the provisions in the Constitution of Nepal. Now, there is a comprehensive explanation for its implementation.” The Supreme Court has raised questions regarding the treatment of the victim when President Ram Chandra Paudel, on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers,  pardoned Yog Raj Dhakal on the occasion of Constitution Day , celebrated on September 20. The Supreme Court has posed inquiries regarding whether the state has furnished social rehabilitation and compensation to the victims. The court order states, “Was the victim’s consent obtained or not?”  These questions remain unanswered. The Supreme Court has mandated careful consideration of five additional aspects in addition to the legal constraints when making decisions regarding the release of prisoners. This is to ensure that the rights of victims are safeguarded, and justice, including compensation, is upheld. The Supreme Court has previously stressed the importance of making release decisions in alignment with the directives and established principles of the Supreme Court. Furthermore, it is recommended to take into account public interests, as well as interests and concerns.  The order specifies, “An order should only be issued after the objective basis and a valid rationale for the decision has been disclosed.” Think about the victim Following the enactment of the  Crime Victim Protection Act (2018)  and the establishment of the compensation fund, victims experienced some relief, and they played no role in the criminal case. The Supreme Court underscored that obtaining the victim’s consent should become mandatory when reducing or mitigating the offender’s punishment. “The actions and decisions taken to reduce the prison sentence of Yog Raj Dhakal, the offender, appeared not to align with Article 21 of the Constitution. Hence, the court cannot grant judicial recognition,” the Supreme Court’s order states. “The decision to reduce Dhakal’s remaining prison sentence was found to violate the rights of crime victims as provided in Article 21 of the Constitution.” When it comes to the rights of crime victims, Nepal is ahead of other South Asian countries says Pradhanang.  “There are not many nations that have protected the constitutional rights of victims and have supplemented them through legislation. In this regard, Nepal stands out as a leading country in South Asia,” he says. “The Supreme Court’s interpretation will not only influence Nepal but could also serve as a model for other nations.” In the context of Nepal’s well-established criminal justice system, provisions for the exemption from imprisonment of offenders and the granting of amnesty have been introduced. While assessing the eligibility for exempting offenders from imprisonment, factors such as their conduct, and the nature and severity of the crime are considered. However, there has been no examination of concessions from the victim’s perspective. To replace civil law, the new criminal code introduced in 2018 has imposed stricter provisions for imprisonment. Convicts in cases involving murder and heinous crimes no longer have access to the privilege of prison exemption, but this change did not consider the role of the victims. Criminologist Pradhanang says that the Supreme Court’s decision will help restore balance, addressing the rising disparities and irregularities in the release of prisoners and the granting of amnesties in Nepal.  “This measure appears to be a deterrent to the practice of granting prison sentences arbitrarily based solely on the legal timeframe. With the victim’s consent now being necessary, it is anticipated that this will significantly restrain the discretionary authority of the prison administration,” he says. “It appears that the current legislation may require amendments to facilitate the implementation of this judgment, and certain legal provisions may need to be added. We currently have limited information based on the brief order, but a more detailed approach may be provided in the full-text, which will aid in determining the future course of action.”",political
Ram Chandra Paudel’s Europe tour postponed,"Kathmandu, November 6 President  Ram Chandra Paudel ‘s Europe tour has been postponed. According to Paudel’s foreign relations advisor, Suresh Chandra Chalise, it was postponed because of the inappropriateness of the President’s foreign trips during a natural disaster. “Due to the difficult situation created by the earthquake in the country, the President’s tour has been postponed,” Chalise said. The President was scheduled to participate in the  Paris Peace Forum  in France on November 8. Following his visit to France, Paudel was due to travel to Germany and Italy, returning to the country on November 17.  However, with the  earthquake  that hit Jajarkot and West Rukum resulting in the death of 153 people, Paudel has decided not to go. Paudel was also facing public pressure to postpone the visit.

Govt to build earthquake-resistant housing in affected areas with a year,"Kathmandu, November 5 The government has decided to make an integrated action plan and build earthquake-resistant housing within one year for the rehabilitation of those affected by the  Jajarkot earthquake  while enabling the search, rescue and relief distribution. During an emergency  Council of Ministers  meeting held at Singha Durbar on Sunday, it was determined that Surkhet will serve as the primary liaison office, with Nepalgunj designated as the secondary liaison office. This decision aims to enhance the efficiency of search, rescue, and relief distribution efforts, as mentioned by Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Rekha Sharma, who also serves as the government spokesperson. The  government will allocate Rs 200,000  to the families of those who lost their lives in the earthquake and  government hospitals will offer free treatment to the injured . Temporary shelters will also be provided for those affected. “Since the reconstruction work cannot be effective through the traditional construction method and the existing procurement act, there is a demand to do the reconstruction work through a robust and effective mechanism, and an action plan will be made accordingly,” said Sharma. She further added that the modality of providing subsidies for the earthquake victims and survivors to construct houses has also been discussed.  “Real victims should get subsidies, and the houses built should be properly utilised,” said Sharma.  The meeting also decided to provide lunch expenses to those deployed in the search, rescue and relief distribution and asked one and all to be patient in this time of disaster.",political

Why is the provincial government not efficient in Nepal?,"In September 2023, I got a chance to interact with around 200 people residing in the seven different provinces of Nepal. I asked them how the  provincial government  is functioning. My respondents expressed their discontent and had a consensus that it was not performing well. In their opinion, the  provincial government is defunct . It is just a burden to the taxpayers. Further, they suggested that the provincial government is to be eliminated, and only then can the local and  federal governments  operate efficiently at low costs. These conversations made me reflect on what should be done to improve the government’s efficiency. Before deliberating on this question, it is relevant to discuss what the government is.   Provincial government in the federal system In principle, the provincial government is the subnational order of the government which shares sovereignty with the federal government and other provincial counterparts. It is meant to address the regional, political, cultural, economic, ethnic, and other aspirations through the direct participation of the people in the governance. In a unitary state, the central government exercises all sovereign powers in the name of the people; however, a limited number of people have a direct involvement in the decision-making structures. In contrast, the provincial government allows the people to exercise their sovereign rights through the representatives whom they have elected. In this sense, the presence of the provincial government does not just facilitate the sharing of sovereignty; it even makes the political system more democratic, inclusive, representative, and just. In other words, a greater number of people get a chance to participate in governance and decision-making. For this reason, the provincial government prevents the central government from imposing its decisions on people having different political, social, cultural, economic, religious, and ethnic backgrounds and checks the tyranny of the centre.  Constitutional provisions regarding provinces The Nepali constitution has envisioned three layers of government: federal, provincial, and local. All these three layers of the government are designed in a horizontal format, which means that they do not remain under the other order of the government. Provinces are autonomous to perform various tasks and also cooperate with federal and local governments in some areas. Therefore, the provincial government enjoys a similar degree of autonomy as the federal and local governments. Further, the constitution provides the provincial government with exclusive powers as well as concurrent powers. In Schedule 6, the constitution has provisioned exclusive provincial powers which include provincial police administration, law and order, civil service, statistics, higher education, universities, health services, land management, protection of languages, cultures, and traditions, and management of trust among others.  In certain areas, the provincial government exercises concurrent rights with local and federal governments. In this respect, the constitution has not hurt the government’s performance. By legislation, there is nothing wrong with it. However, the areas of improvement are huge.  Performance of the provincial government in practice  In practice, the provincial government is not meeting the public expectations through its performance. During my fieldwork, I talked to many people belonging to different provinces. However, not even a single respondent approved the provincial government’s works. The public does not even want its presence at all. Even some political parties are not content with its performance. Its recent example is the Rastriya Swayantra Party (RSP) which did not even  field its candidate in the past nationwide provincial election (2022) . The party leaders suggested that they did not have enough time to field the candidates. Notwithstanding the leaders’ statements, nothing could prevent this party from fielding a few candidates, at least symbolically, in any provincial constituencies, had this party chosen to do so. This does not, however, mean that they have not done anything. All provincial governments have accomplished the important task of choosing a name and headquarters for their respective provinces. They have made certain legislation in the areas of provincial police, civil service, higher education, and provincial taxes among others. However, this performance is not sufficient to address the needs and expectations of the common people residing in those regions.     The most notable failure is that the provincial governments are susceptible to instability and changes like their federal counterpart. After the recent election (2022), all seven provinces, for instance, struggled to form a government even after the months passed. In the national election, the Nepali Congress became the first largest party with the UML and Maoist Center respectively in second and third position. After the election, the UML  supported Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal as the Prime Minister  in exchange for lucrative portfolios in the provincial governments. The working coalition between two major federal parties also led to the formation of identical coalitions in the provinces. Later, the circumstances changed, and the Maoists and the UML found it  difficult to work together . Still, Dahal remained the Prime Minister; however, this time the NC lent its support. The new coalition induced ripple effects in the provincial orders of the governments. The situation became so bad that provincial leaders waited the signals from the federal leaders to participate or refuse to participate in the government. In short, instability has become a new reality among the provincial governments of Nepal. If the governments cannot survive on their own, how can we expect good governance from them? Where does the problem lie?  In my analysis, the problem lies in the constitutional provision regarding the political parties. In  part 29, the constitution has included “provisions relating to political parties” , which are about the formation, registration, and operation of political parties. It ascertains the unconstrained operation of the political parties but does not include any provision relating to the federation of the political parties themselves. In the present structure, the federal political leaders form committees, make decisions, and choose leaders in provincial and local structures. The provincial parties are not autonomous in operation, and the political parties are entirely centralised within the federal governance. Therefore, the provincial governments cannot make any decisions that are against the interests of the federal leaders. The centralised structure of political parties has consequently hurt their growth, development, and performance.   Way ahead   After years of struggles, Nepal has transformed into a federal democratic republic, and the provincial government is the heart of the federal system. Therefore, to eliminate the provinces is to eliminate the entire federal system. The only way ahead is to improve on legislative weaknesses and make the provincial government effective. It is thus important to amend the constitutional provisions and federate the structure of political parties so that local, provincial, and federal parties remain autonomous in operation and status. Such autonomy minimises the interference of the federal parties, which will support the provincial parties to autonomously form and dissolve the governments besides enhancing their performance.",political

Stakeholders voice concerns over the formation of political committees in schools,"All Nepal National Independent Students’ Union  (ANNISU, Revolutionary), the student wing of the CPN Maoist Centre, on August 17, formed a political committee at Panchayan Secondary School of  Dhurkot rural municipality  in Gulmi. The students involved in the committee were made to participate in a tree plantation programme with a banner of the organisation.  Rajan KC, district president of ANNISU, says that the school committee is being formed under the Maoist campaign Janata Sanga Maobadi (Maoist with the public).   “Students should be aware of politics. They should raise their voice about the affairs happening in the country,” says KC. “So we are forming committees in schools.” Nepal Student Union , the student wing of the Nepali Congress in its statute has mentioned that one must first hold the position of the president of the student unit in order to be eligible for the presidency of the union. To address the provision, the political committee is being formed in different schools of the Dang district, says Kulraj Pokharel, NSU Dang president. “The school unit works for the rights of the students and quality of education. It does not perform any kind of political activities.”  Akin to students of Maoist Centre and NC, the student wing of CPN-UML is also forming their committee in different schools.  All Nepal National Free Students Union  (UML), the student wing of CPN-UML have recently decided to form a school committee of grades 8 to 12, all over Dolakha.  Jip Chhiring Lama, immediate past president of ANNFSU says that the decision to form a student committee in schools is made according to the statute of an organisation.   “Besides educational issues, students should also be informed about social and political issues and for that there is a need to form a committee,” says Lama.   The three examples mentioned above clearly indicate that student unions affiliated with political parties are establishing political committees within schools. Despite political parties declaring schools as peace zones, this situation continues to raise questions about the integrity of schools in Nepal. Amidst this, stakeholders and educators have expressed concerns regarding the committees formed by political student organisations within educational institutions. Concern political committees at school After extensive discussions regarding the peace zone proposal, political parties, educators, student organisations, and various stakeholders were consulted, and their consent was taken before the formation of the political committees. After the declaration of schools as peace zones; the essential guidelines for their implementation have been formulated, and outlined in the School Peace Zone National Framework and Implementation Guidelines, 2011.  This directive has three main objectives. Firstly, to keep the school free from armed activities and other violence. Secondly, to keep it free from party politics and other interference and lastly to keep it free from discrimination, abuse, neglect and exploitation.  Moreover, educationalist Bidya Nath Koirala says that it is painful to see that political parties are creating an unhealthy environment in schools.  “It is a bad practice of political parties to make the school student their cadre,” says Koirala.  Likewise, according to Ram Prasad Neupane, president of the Guardian Association of Community Schools, political parties can not make school students involved in political activity because the law has stated grades 9 to 12 as a secondary level.   “Once the political parties enter school it will start showing its effect. So they should be prohibited from entering school,” says Neupane.  He further urged political parties to strictly stop forming committees in schools.  “The intention of those committees is to make the students cadres of political parties rather than critical thinkers”, he says.  After facing criticism, student leaders, however, are falsely claiming that they are forming a committee for students in grades 11 and 12, asserting that those below grade 10 are still within the peace zone. That said, the student leaders openly admit that they are dissatisfied with the decision to include grades 11 and 12 at the secondary level, a decision that was made in 2017. “When the schools were designated as peace zones, the secondary level comprised up to class 10. Classes 11 and 12 were considered part of higher education. Since 2017, classes up to 12 were incorporated into the school level, but we haven’t altered our policy,” says Narayan Gharti vice president of ANNFSU. Gharti says that their party’s statute explicitly prohibits the formation of political committees comprising students studying below grade 10.  “We do not form a committee of students studying below grade 10,” says Magar.  Similarly, Naresh Regmi, vice president of  ANNISU also agrees with Gharti and says, “At the age of 16, when students reach grade 10, they are eligible to obtain citizenship, which underscores the importance of raising political awareness among them.”   President of NSU, Dujang Sherpa, also asserts that their parties have not taken any actions against the concept of Schools as Zones of Peace. On September 7, ANNFSU formed an 11-member committee at Maneydanda Secondary School in Gauri Shankar rural municipality-2, Dolakha. The president of the committee is Bishal Karki a grade 10 student. In Panchayan Secondary School of Gulmi, ANNISU established a committee consisting of students from grades 9 to 12. Sushil Chhetri, a grade 10 student is heading the political committee. Continuation of Panchayat practice  Stakeholders say that political activities conducted by student organisations in defiance of the school peace zone declaration represent a continuation of practices reminiscent of the Panchayat era. After the Panchayat banned the parties, the leaders went to the schools and began mobilising students politically. Tanka Karki, former president of ANNFSU, says that the formation of committees was implemented as a means to raise students’ awareness about the oppressive nature of the Panchayat regime “Due to the necessity of the situation at that time, the society also easily accepted the politics in the school,” says Karki.  However, time has changed due to which Karki believes that society is reacting to the political activities at the school level. Even he himself does not see the need for political committees at the school level.  “Now there is no restriction for political parties, they are active enough. Children should not be dragged into politics,” says Karki. Likewise, Ramkumari Jhankri, former president of ANNFSU, also says that student organisations should not be run in the traditional way. However, it does not mean that they should be dormant. “Like earlier they should not be made to participate in rallies and protests to make those events look huge,” says Jhakri.   Laxmi Khatiwada, the former leader of NSU says that the politics has not just affected the school level but the entire education sector.  “Due to the interference of political parties, the university has reached such a worse state. Now the entire education sector should be made free from the interference of political parties,” says Khatiwada.

Nepal’s carefree Finance Minister,"On October 2,  Finance Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat left for Marrakech, Morocco  for a week to attend the annual meeting of the World Bank. He was not alone; he was accompanied by his entourage. With him were Finance Secretary Dr Krishna Hari Pushkar, Head of the International Development Assistance Coordination Division and Joint Secretary, Shree Krishna Nepal, as well as Under Secretary Narayan Dhakal. This marked Mahat’s fifth visit to a foreign country in the past five months. During a period when the country is facing economic challenges, Mahat has consistently opted to leave the country for foreign trips. Consequently, the government has fallen behind in achieving its targeted economic growth and has encountered difficulties in implementing the plans outlined in the budget. Furthermore, the government has been unable to allocate more than 3.86 per cent of the capital expenditure, indicating that the budgets for numerous projects are likely to be put on hold. So, while the country is reeling economically, how is it that the finance ministry seems so chill? Can a person, who holds such power over the economic state of the country not care about and go on foreign junkets which could be attended joint or under secretary of the ministry? Economic challenges While the external sector of the economy seems to be in a relatively stable position, thanks to the  rise in remittances  and a decrease in imports, the real estate and financial sectors are currently contending with significant challenges. Stagnation persists in sectors like construction, agriculture, industry, and transportation. As of October 3, the World Bank has reported a meagre economic growth of only 3.1 per cent for this year. Consumers are facing the challenge of a high inflation rate of 7.52 percent. This economic slowdown is affecting not only household businesses but also capital markets, and it has led to an expansion of debt at a lower rate. The double-digit interest rate has left entrepreneurs and businesspersons disheartened. In the run-up to Dashain and Tihar, as economic activities slow down, it is a challenging time for small and large investors with their confidence eroded. Where is the Finance Minister? A former Finance Secretary says the Ministry of Finance is tasked with overseeing economic and financial discipline. While it endeavours to uphold financial discipline, it also exerts pressure on other ministries and agencies to practice fiscal prudence. Unfortunately, the current situation appears to be quite the opposite. The Ministry of Finance itself has issued austerity guidelines for the current financial year 2023/24 for all ministries, departments and agencies to reduce current expenditure. The guidance states that due to their strategic importance and international relations, participation in international forums, conferences, and intergovernmental meetings is mandatory. However, the Ministry of Finance itself is not adhering to the ‘mandatory program’ outlined in the guidance. Instead, ministers and officials from the ministry have been consistently occupied with visits to foreign countries under the pretext of invitations from donor agencies. Morroco marks the Finance Minister’s fifth foreign visit in just four months, with three of those trips occurring within the past month and a half alone. It is worth noting that when Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal undertook an official visit to India in May, Finance Minister Mahat was also part of the delegation. Prakash Sharan Mahat embarked on several international visits in recent months. In June, he travelled to India to participate in the G20 finance track meeting. He was accompanied by the Head of the International Economic Coordination Division and Joint Secretary, Shree Krishna Nepal, along with his personal secretary, Yuvraj Pandey. On August 20, he visited Canada to partake in the seventh meeting of the Global Environment Facility. Joining him on this trip were the Joint Secretary at the Budget and Programme Division, Uttar Kumar Khatri; the Joint Secretary at the International Economic Cooperation Coordination Division, Shreekrishna Nepal; Under Secretary of the Forest and Environment Ministry, Gyanendra Kumar Mishra, as well as Under Secretary of the Finance Ministry and his personal secretary, Yuvraj Pandey. Furthermore, Finance Minister Mahat journeyed to Cairo, Egypt on September 22 to participate in the annual meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). He was accompanied by Revenue Secretary, Dr Ram Prasad Ghimire, and Under Secretary of International Economic Assistance Coordination Division, Kanchan Basnet. Just 11 days following his return from Cairo, Mahat embarked on a trip to Morocco, accompanied by another sizable high-level delegation. Upon his return from Morocco, he is slated to travel to the UK. Notably, Mahat has received approval to take part in a significant investment conference in London, UK. Although the conference is scheduled to commence on November 23, he secured approval from the Council of Ministers nearly a month and a half ago, confirming his attendance. Fun and games Economist Dr Resham Thapa points out that the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are not taking the economic challenges seriously enough. He argues that the severity of the situation is exacerbated by the consecutive foreign trips of the Finance Minister, which the government has not addressed adequately.  “The root cause of the economic challenges we are facing in the economy is the weak capacity of financial and revenue administration. Financial administration is not effective, efficient, or honest, which is causing a crisis in the economy,” says Thapa. He says that even the political leadership seems to be more interested in making stunts and having fun rather than fulfilling their roles. He believes that the culture of going on trips and enjoying government positions among government personnel is worsening the state of the economy.  “The culture of enjoying trips has raised questions about the government’s indifference to the economic situation,” he says. Thapa also suggests that the Finance Minister should focus on addressing pressing issues instead of displaying contrary behaviour.

Koshi Province gets yet another chief minister with Kedar Karki due to take oath of office,"Biratnagar, October 15 In an interesting turn of events, Kedar Karki of the Nepal Congress has been appointed the chief minister of  Koshi Province . This comes after he revolted against the party’s decision to support a Maoist Lawmaker for the chief minister position. On Saturday, Kedar Karki was appointed chief minister with the backing of 39 members from the UML and eight members from the rebel faction of the Congress. He is set to take the oath of office and secrecy on Sunday. After the ruling coalition nominated Indra Bahadur Angbo as the chief minister, Karki and eight other Nepali Congress lawmakers opposed after which he became the chief minister of Koshi Province. On Saturday, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, and leader Dr Shekhar Koirala accepted Karki as the chief minister, affirming their commitment to the alliance. After Karki’s appointment, Prime Minister Dahal stated that Karki is the candidate of the coalition. Upon reaching Chitwan following an agreement with Deuba and Koirala, Prime Minister Dahal said this was best for the coalition. “He said he will help strengthen the coalition,” said Dahal. His term is not going to be easy. As he has rebelled in the party and sought help from the UML, there is a strong dissatisfaction within the party. Kedar Karki plans on including the UML during his government formation which is going to be tricky. But he says all involved are backing him as he ensured there will not be a mid-term election in Koshi Province. The chief minister position of Koshi province has  not been stable .",political
Procedure ready to register names of Nepali citizens abroad in voter list,"Kathmandu, October 13 The Election Commission has drafted a procedure for registering the  voter list of Nepali citizens  residing abroad and updating it. The Commission is now inviting suggestions on this draft. According to the draft procedure, Nepali citizens living in foreign countries who have not yet been listed in the voter registry can now be included in the system directly from abroad. The Commission  uploaded the draft procedure  on its website on Thursday and has encouraged all concerned parties to provide their feedback. The draft proposes assigning countries for the registration of names in the voter list of Nepali citizens and suggests establishing centres through the respective diplomatic missions of each country. An arrangement has been made where the commission will write to the Foreign Ministry to assign concerned employees to register names in the voter list. Nepalis living abroad could select a place and date appropriate for them for biometric collection after filling out the form through the online system if they want to register their names in the voter list.  Anyone willing to provide suggestions on the provisions incorporated in the draft could do so within November 16.",political
Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s diplomatic dance: Unexpected triumphs in US and China relations,"During a period when the media was abuzz with discourse, all eyes and ears were fixed on Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chair of the Maoist Centre. The focal point was how he would address the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)  issue while managing the persistent pressure exerted by self-proclaimed elite communities, who consistently voiced their opinions through Twitter. In a surprising turn of events, Dahal cleverly outmanoeuvred them, taking a bold step that ultimately led to his victory. This also happened against the background of several petitions filed by familiar foes, mostly on issues falling under the jurisdiction of the TRC, as well as on some political statements made by Dahal during political rallies. These petitions, driven by the sole intention of sowing confusion and potentially derailing an already overwhelmed justice system, will likely yield nothing more than show-cause orders from the judiciary. In regards to those petitions, it appears that these familiar adversaries intend to generate confusion among the general public and inadvertently further burden the already congested justice system. It is conceivable that these opponents were counting on Dahal not seizing the opportunity to address these pressing issues on a global platform, such as the UN General Assembly in New York while dealing with matters at home. Unsurprisingly, Dahal known for his penchant and tendency for unexpected political maneuvers, went ahead and not only attended the 78th UNGA at the United Nations Headquarters in New York but engaged in bilateral with several world leaders and high-level UN delegates. The message was clear: Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is the only signatory alive of the Comprehensive Peace Accord signed between the Nepal Government and the then Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) on November 22, 2006, remains committed to ensuring the peace process comes to a lawful and peaceful conclusion. He expressed and reassured the international community of his commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, and international humanitarian laws and fundamental principles and values related to human rights. Dahal’s powerful message As the Chair of the  Group of Least Developed Countries , Dahal used the platform not only to discuss pressing matters concerning Least Developed Countries, including climate change, Sustainable Development Goals, and development cooperation but also deftly used his 19 minutes on the UNGA podium to address the crucial issues surrounding Nepal’s peace process and the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission  (TRC). His statements, as summarised briefly by the UN webpage, clearly show how tactfully he started his speech. The opening statement of his speech conveyed a potent message to the global community. Furthermore, Pushpa Kamal Dahal has demonstrated his humility and sought help from the international community, which reiterates his commitment to the international community and his readiness to work together with all stakeholders. He also met with United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres at the United Nations headquarters in New York. His message was clear again: “I am dedicated to ensuring that Nepal’s peace process adheres to the terms of the peace accord.” Do not be astonished if the UN Secretary-General pays a visit to Nepal shortly. He also took the opportunity to hold a meeting with Rabab Fatima, the UN High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States. Following his visit to the US, he promptly headed to China, where he engaged in one-on-one meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Additionally, he engaged in discussions with Premier Li Qiang and had an audience with the Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, Zhao Leji.  These meetings played a pivotal role in fortifying mutual trust and laid the foundation for numerous Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) across diverse sectors. The establishment of these relationships, anchored in the shared social and economic progress of the peoples of both nations, held particular significance in light of the delayed or postponed engagements due to the Covid pandemic. The outcome of his visits Let us shift our attention from the finer details of his visit, which have already been extensively covered by numerous media outlets, and instead, concentrate on the results of the visit. While labelled by some as an unsuccessful visit, certain politicians, self-proclaimed elites, and several media sources dismissed it as a mere tourist and leisure trip, considering Dahal’s journey a success. Our tendency has often been fixated on the notion that success equates to immediate gains. However, in this instance, it did not yield such outcomes, nor did it meet general expectations. However, the utmost respect and political importance given to Dahal’s visit by the Chinese side is something to value. We should not take it for granted. Not long ago, we were busy criticising how India laid a low-level welcome to Dahal. Our core objective should be to build on this relationship and yield the results gradually. In diplomacy, the most important tool is a relationship, and clearly, Dahal has outdone all his predecessors. His body language throughout the trip is evident and he came out as a reliable leader and a trusted neighbour. Pushpa Kamal Dahal has proven himself a skilled diplomat, in my observation spanning since 2006 when I first joined the UN. I hold a strong belief that he is the leader in Nepal capable of aligning diverse interests and producing tangible outcomes. His recent visit is a clear testament to his ability to achieve the intended results. One could make the argument, and I do not fault anyone for this perspective, as we tend to gauge the success or failure of an official visit based on what agreements were reached and what was gained for us during these engagements. We are not very keen on developing our friendship, understanding cultures, and building bridges. For instance, I was talking to one of my comrades, a martyr’s son, who asked me what my thoughts were on Dahal’s visit to China. Before I responded, he further added that he viewed Dahal’s visit as a family vacation, which made him recall his childhood when his mama (maternal uncle) took him to Pokhara on a family trip. He, like most of us, expected some landmark signing or a chunk of donation. Mind you, this comrade is one of the brightest minds among youths who is enrolled in law school, running an online news portal, and supporting several social movements. If his reasoning for success or failure is material-based, what about most of us? Too quick to judge? It is no surprise that most of us termed his visit a failure. Therefore, general expectations would be that he should have at least touched on issues on border and security issues like his predecessors, or the newly found patriotic issue –  Nepal’s newly published map . Dahal took rather cautious steps on those issues; however, one cannot deny that a significant start has been made: the joint statement summarised the MoU on cooperation in the field of agriculture, livestock and fisheries and also the readiness to explore the joint development of an agriculture industrial demonstration part to further promote cooperation on agriculture. This is a good step in the long run if abided by. The joint statement further read that the two sides also agreed to undertake a joint inspection of the China-Nepal border and agreed to bring into force the agreement between the government of the People’s Republic of China and the government of Nepal on the Boundary Management System as soon as possible. They also agreed to expedite the ratification of the China-Nepal treaty on mutual legal assistance in Criminal Matters. Are these steps not important for us? In summary, despite garnering mixed reactions, Dahal’s two-week visit can be deemed an accidental success. I label it as accidental because it surpassed even Dahal’s expectations, and he has every reason to take pride in it.  Notably, Dahal, often characterised as emotional by many leaders due to his heartfelt decision-making approach, approached both crucial issues—the conclusion of Nepal’s peace process in UNGA, and security matters with China—with careful consideration. The Times of India headlined on September 27:  Nepal PM ‘Prachanda’ apparently declines to endorse President Xi’s security doctrine during China visit . This is phenomenal and a very important diplomatic step. Is this not a smart move? Who can snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat like Dahal? Upon his return to Nepal, within hours, not only was Dahal able to resume the parliament, which was strongly opposed by the UML on the gold smuggling probe row, but the mighty main opposition leader was his cheerleader while he briefed about his visit –– this is Dahal and his ability to resolve the differences. History will dictate right or wrong, success or failure, but for now, we all should cherish the accidental success that has been delivered in his visit.",political

Mid-term in Koshi Province highly likely after Hikmat Karki resigns as chief minister,"Biratnagar, October 8 Chief Minister of Koshi Province, Hikmat Karki, resigned from his post on Saturday. During Saturday’s meeting of the Koshi Province Assembly, Karki announced his resignation. On October 4, in accordance with Article 168 (3) of the constitution, he submitted a proposal for a vote of confidence at the Koshi Province Assembly secretariat. However, he announced his resignation from the post after realising that there was no possibility of obtaining a vote of confidence during the meeting. Expressing his commitment to the supremacy of the constitution, he mentioned that he resigned from the post because the people of Koshi Province did not want an election. Karki stressed that if the current context and complexities are neglected, a mid-term election in the province is inevitable. He further stated that achieving consensus, fostering collaboration, and uniting political parties is imperative to avert a mid-term election and establish a stable government. He highlighted that forming a consensus government was the best alternative, as none of the political parties in the Koshi Province Assembly held a clear majority. In light of this, the Governor of Koshi Province, Parshuram Khapung, has urged the formation of a government within a week.

"Local government-led development sparks hope, reinforcing the need for stronger federalism","Bhupal Pokharel the chair of  Dhurkot rural municipality  is excited about branding and marketing local lemons and oranges. During the Covid pandemic in 2020, the local government launched a program to cultivate barren land with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency in food production and exporting fruits. To implement the plan, the local government decided to give subsidies to farmers who grow lemons, oranges and fruits on land that had been barren for two years. This initiative also helped in retaining the youth who were in the village due to the pandemic. The rural municipality is providing a subsidy of Rs 3,000 per plant to those who cultivate lemons, oranges, and other fruits on land that has been barren for two years.  Additionally, they also offer Rs 4,000 per plant for those engaged in the cultivation of grains, vegetables, and spices. Farmers who grow vegetables and fruits on leased land receive Rs 5,000 per plant in subsidy.  According to Hom Narayan Shrestha, the former chair of the  Municipal Association of Nepal , most local governments, including Dhurkot rural municipality in Gulmi, have implemented a rule stating that land must not be left barren. These lands were barren mostly due to people leaving the village during the armed conflict. Fast forward 20 years, things have changed after the peace process and promulgation of the constitution with local governments like Dhurkot running successful agricultural projects as mentioned above.  “Local governments are giving subsidies even in agricultural production, arranging agricultural tools, distributing seeds and sending veterinary doctors from house to house. This helps everyone,” says Shrestha. Serving the locals Until six years ago, when local residents from Malika in Myagdi fell ill, they had to be transported on stretchers to the headquarters in Beni for treatment. “Many have lost their lives due to this,” says Beg Prasad Garbuja, chair of  Malika rural municipality . “After the establishment of local governments, this has changed. We have emphasised building roads and ensuring people have access to education and health care.” According to Garbuja, Malika had a primary health centre in the past. Now, the primary health centre has been upgraded and transformed into a 15-bed hospital. Additionally, there are 10 more community health units spread across the village. Following the local government’s emphasis on road infrastructure, it has become much more convenient to navigate through the capital and major cities of the country, he says. Roads now extend to all the wards, greatly enhancing accessibility for logistics and market transportation. “The face of many remote villages has changed after the local government started setting aside budgets for projects,” says Garbuja. “The people are also taking ownership in these projects and have started to make us alert on various issues.” Some local governments also offer scholarships for  technical education , engineering, and MBBS programs, aiming to inspire individuals to pursue careers in civil service and contribute to the envisioned sustainable development of the city. Take Jumla’s  Chandannath municipality  and  Patarasi rural municipality  as examples. Both are providing scholarships to one MBBS student each with the aim of producing doctors in the  Karnali region . Some local governments in rural Nepal have also been organising free preparation classes for public service examinations. According to Pemma Wangchen Gurung, vice chair of the  Shey Phoksundo- rural municipality  of  Dolpa , public service preparation classes are being organised for underprivileged individuals including the poor, Dalits, conflict victims, and members of ethnic and marginalised communities. These classes aim to support those who were unable to pursue their studies due to financial constraints but aspire to enter the civil service. In addition to this, the  Shey Phoksundo  rural municipality has introduced the concept of ‘one house, one business,’ with a specific emphasis on promoting animal husbandry. The rural municipality has established a cooperative in each ward under its own coordination. “Exporting materials such as milk, curd, cheese and meat has been facilitated through cooperatives,” says Wangchen. “The locals are realising the importance of federalism and federalism is needed more for the rural areas.” “We are moving forward in such a way that we can keep ourselves in check to reduce minor epidemics and calamities.” Hopeful scenario due to local government Hom Narayan Shrestha, the former president of the Municipal Association of Nepal says a lot has changed in the past six years. He says the public schools are better and the number of students in the schools is also on the up with low dropout rates. “This is thanks to the proactiveness of the local level,” says Shrestha. The local government’s initiatives include providing scholarships to students from marginalised families and covering lunch expenses. This has had a significant positive impact on education in the area. Shrestha believes various local governments are looking to invest in education and health rather than roads because they believe this is what will shape their constituency and build a better society in the future. “Roads have reached most parts of Madhes Province but I do not think it is developed,” he says. He points out how the human development index of Karnali is better than in some villages in Madhesh. “On the whole, the efforts made by the local government in public services, education, health and other sectors, the protection and development of government property have made the people enthusiastic about their future,” says Shrestha. In  Schedule 8 of the Constitution , there are subject areas delineating the exclusive authority of local government. The common rights list, shared by the f ederation, province, and local levels , comprises 15 subjects. As outlined in the work elaboration report, the local level is tasked with executing a total of 355 tasks. These rights and their associated functions span political, administrative, social, developmental, and financial domains. However, stakeholders say that the local level is average in terms of utilising the acquired rights. Balananda Paudel, the chair of the  Local Level Restructuring Commission , says that the first term of the local government was spent on building infrastructure, allocating resources and creating a legal basis. “Citizens have felt the presence of local government all over the country. Being on the front line, people’s hopes and confidence have increased,” says Paudel. Struggle with centralised thinking Kathmandu metropolitan city’s Mayor  Balen Shah  and Dharan sun-metropolitan city’s Mayor  Harka Sangpang  have taken different initiatives in their respective area, which has done the job of informing the people about the jurisdiction of the local government. Mayor Balen Shah even issued a statement to the federal government, emphasising the importance of adhering to the constitutional provisions and subject areas. “The constitution and laws of Nepal have entrusted the Kathmandu metropolitan city with the managerial authority to make laws, the executive authority to implement the law and the judicial authority to settle disputes,” Mayor Balen said in a statement issued on August 28, 2022. “When you have executive authority, it is not appropriate to remain in a state of inaction without using it. We firmly believe that.” Administrative expert Kashiraj Dahal says that the initiative of the local government to use the acquired rights should be taken positively. “This is what the common people want – no one can encroach on the government land, and the river cannot be converted into a place to mine sand and rocks. The initiative taken in this case has not only won the hearts of the citizens, but it shows that the local government is trying to be established as a government,” Dahal told Onlinekhabar. However, in such a time, Dahal holds the belief that the representatives in the federal and provincial governments are conveying a message of distrust towards the local government. He suggests that the federal government’s lack of support for local governance seems to be a deliberate policy stance. Local-level planner Keshav Prasad Bhattarai’s experience is that the federal government is trying to move forward by keeping all local governments under its control.  According to Bhattarai, the federal civil service bill, designed in a way that places the chief administrative officer of the local level under the authority of the federal government, along with the school education bill registered in the House of Representatives with federal government intervention, serve as strong examples of policy conflicts. According to Bhattarai, who played a key role in the development of 35 local-level master plans in the previous term, there has been a persistent state of confusion stemming from the federal government’s failure to address critical issues that require its attention. There is a constitutional provision stating that if provincial or local laws conflict with federal laws, they are automatically invalidated. Even if a law made by the local government contradicts a provincial law, it is rendered ineffective. “The local government spent its first term hoping that the federal government would make the laws. When it did not, it felt the provincial government would make the laws. Such a mistake will not be repeated. It does not help anyone,” says Bhattarai. Balanand Poudel, chair of the Local Level Restructuring Commission, also suggests that the local government should try take do what i rightfully theirs. “It seems that we should always be aware of whether the policies that have come are in the process of making laws or are in the process of being made, are compatible with the constitution or not,” he says. “This light of hope and enthusiasm should not be extinguished.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Exploring the education bill: Understanding teachers’ protests in Kathmandu,"It is shocking to see a sizable crowd of educators from all over the country protesting the  recently tabled   Education Bill.  Contrary to the prevailing notion that these teachers were mere pawns of political parties, this spectacle sparked serious questions. What are the driving forces behind the Education Bill controversy? Transitioning to a non-profit education system, the proposed bill advocates for the conversion of over 8,000 private schools into the non-profit Guthi system, aiming to mitigate commercialisation and enhance educational accessibility. However, a critical inquiry arises: Is this approach appropriate, and has research been conducted to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the non-profit Guthi system in comparison to current private schools? It is crucial to carefully analyse potential consequences and strike a balance that ensures educational quality while addressing the issue of profit-driven motives. Balancing socio-economic factors and considering the educational capabilities of communities is paramount in shaping an approach that effectively addresses Nepal’s specific needs and challenges.  The  Education Bill  and the challenges are explained below: Empowering local authorities: Is decentralisation the way forward? A significant shift in authority has occurred with the education bill proposing the decentralisation of educational responsibilities, particularly the transition from the district education office to local municipalities. Previously, the district education office oversaw school construction, but now municipalities will play a vital role. It will be responsible for appointing school principals based on teacher examinations. While adhering to national standards, local level will have the autonomy to manage public schools, regulate operations, and oversee teachers The municipalities’ heads are elected by the people without any specific educational requirements. This raises a critical question—do the elected heads of municipalities possess the necessary capabilities to effectively carry out these responsibilities, or should the task remain with the district education office, headed by a qualified individual who has successfully cleared the demanding Lok Sewa examination in Nepal? Another pressing concern revolves around the financial implications for municipalities when establishing new schools. In cities like Kathmandu and Lalitpur, municipalities generate substantial revenue through taxes levied on citizens and businesses. However, the collected tax revenue varies across different municipalities. The question thus arises: how can rural municipalities muster the necessary funds to establish, manage, and compensate teachers for new public schools, given their limited tax revenue and financial resources? Addressing these fundamental questions is crucial to ensuring the effective implementation of decentralisation efforts. Striking a balance between local empowerment and educational quality, especially in financially constrained rural areas, is essential and needs to be addressed in the education bill. Additionally, exploring sustainable funding mechanisms and considering equitable distribution of resources will be pivotal in bolstering educational opportunities for all, regardless of geographic location and economic capacity. What language to use? The education bill has a regulation stipulating computer science and mathematics will exclusively taught in English. This is a policy I firmly oppose. The origins and rationale behind implementing this rule remain unclear, leaving me puzzled about the considerations that led to its adoption. Subjects like science and mathematics are inherently challenging to study, and mandating they be taught in English, a language not commonly mastered as a second language by most Nepalis, poses a significant obstacle. Even developed nations do not enforce compulsory instruction in these subjects in English. Therefore, it is essential to contemplate the primary objective of teaching these subjects. Is it to enhance English fluency or to impart fundamental knowledge about math and science? Personally, I pursued my math education in Nepali until the fifth grade, and the transition to English instruction in the sixth grade did not deter my passion for these subjects. Moreover, I excelled in math, securing the highest score in my class and eventually earning a gold medal during my masters. Learning in Nepali did not weaken my academic prowess; in fact, it laid a strong foundation for my understanding of math and science. Upon reviewing this directive, it is apparent to me that the new regulation seems inclined to gradually eradicate our native language, Nepali, from the education system. Is this what the education bill wants to do? This raises valid concerns about the implications this might hold for the future. There’s a well-known saying, “What is a nation without a mother tongue?” by Jack Edwards, underscoring the critical role of a mother tongue in preserving culture and identity. This move could jeopardise Nepali students, many of whom are not proficient in English, potentially exacerbating the disparity in educational opportunities between students in urban centres like Kathmandu and those in smaller towns and villages. Specific directives promoting inclusive education In order to support children with special needs, provisions have been made for open and mobile schools, particularly in geographically challenging regions. Allocated welfare funds are now designated for the establishment and operation of model or specialised schools, guaranteeing a superior standard of education encompassing various subjects. This progressive step within the education bill is applauded, emphasising the imperative of inclusivity in education. Regulations affecting foreign and private schools This regulation imposes constraints on the fee structures of private schools, aligning them with local and national laws. In recent times, the cost of private education has surged significantly, making it challenging for parents to afford high fee structures. However, economic principles of supply and demand underscore that schools can charge these amounts due to existing demand. If parents are unwilling to pay such fees, schools cannot sustain these charges and may lose students. Implementing fee limitations may indeed affect the quality of education due to reduced funding, potentially driving parents to opt for education in other countries. Teaching licences and advanced credentials The stipulation of teaching licences as a prerequisite for employment is a commendable initiative put forward by the education bill. However, mandating a master’s degree for educators at the basic level in the context of Nepal raises questions about feasibility and practicality. Striking a balance between stringent qualifications and the availability of qualified teachers is crucial to ensuring an adequate teaching force. Inclusive hiring and gender representation While promoting gender inclusivity in teacher recruitment is important, practical considerations must be acknowledged. The designated quota for women in education exams aims to bolster female representation in the teaching profession. Yet striking the right balance between qualification requirements and inclusivity is essential to maintaining educational standards. Challenges in teacher benefits and incentives The  decision to discontinue pensions for teachers post from March 18, 2019 , raises concerns about teacher incentives and overall morale. Teaching, often considered a fallback option, requires appropriate incentives to attract and retain qualified individuals. Addressing the disparity in benefits compared to other civil servants and ensuring adequate incentives is vital for motivating teachers and sustaining a dedicated workforce. For instance, civil servants are entitled to discounted healthcare services at the Civil Hospital in Baneshwar, Kathmandu, whereas teachers are not offered the same benefit. Balancing teacher leaves and responsibilities The provision of automatic dismissal after a 15-day break for teachers warrants careful consideration. While this rule intends to maintain attendance and accountability, it should be applied judiciously. Instances of genuine need, such as medical emergencies, should be accommodated through a structured system of substitute teachers, ensuring that frivolous excuses for extended leaves are appropriately addressed while safeguarding teachers’ rights. Maintaining political neutrality among teachers Regulation in the education bill ensures that educators refrain from engaging in political activities, thus fostering an impartial and unbiased learning atmosphere within schools. In a democratic society, it is imperative to avoid bias in hiring based on political affiliations. I, myself, do not align with any political party, appreciating the freedom to choose in our democratic nation. An individual’s actions outside of their professional hours, within legal bounds, should remain their personal concern and not be imposed upon the educational environment. This includes refraining from expressing political opinions to students, even for those not affiliated with any political stance. Local level exams: Evaluating a shift from centralised assessments The proposal to conduct Class 8 and Class 12 exams at the local level marks a departure from the current centralised assessment approach. The responsibility of preparing the Class 8 Board Exam Question Paper will rest with the District Education Office. Moreover, after nearly a century of existence, the School Leaving Certificate/ Secondary Education Examination (SLC/SEE) examination control office for Class 10 will be discontinued, with schools administering the exams. However, the suitability of this shift for Nepal warrants careful consideration. In the existing education system, students study until SEE (Secondary Education Examination) and then choose between vocational education, +2, or internationally affiliated degrees. Students often engage in part-time jobs to meet their financial needs. One concern lies in the provision for students aspiring to pursue foreign university-affiliated courses like IB and A-levels. If this option is not adequately accommodated within the local exam system, parents and students may opt to seek these degrees abroad, resulting in a loss of foreign currency for Nepal. To ensure that Nepal has a wide range of educational options, the move towards localised exams should come with thoughtful provisions for students hoping to pursue international curricula. This will help retain students within the country and contribute to the national economy by minimising the outflow of funds for education sought abroad. Balancing local assessment with opportunities for pursuing diverse educational paths is crucial for the overall growth and development of the education sector in Nepal.",political

Democracy dies in darkness,"An uncomfortable truth, but a truth nonetheless — our democracy is dying in darkness. In the murky depths of a faltering democracy, our nation is confronting the chilling apparition of obscurity. Corruption, nepotism, and favouritism have taken root, enfeebling the very bedrock of governance.  Hence, there are the dangers of a nation besieged by rampant corruption, where leaders act with impunity, and questionable transparency in governance, the  youth are compelled to seek opportunities overseas , and remittance becomes the life force of the economy. Corruption  has metastasised like a malignant tumour within the halls of power, eroding public trust and undermining the democratic tapestry of the nation. Leaders entrusted with the duty to serve the people have shamelessly capitulated to avarice and personal enrichment. The absence of accountability has fostered flourishing corruption, diverting vital resources intended for the welfare of the populace. Leaders immersed in corrupt practices often turn a blind eye to smuggling, exacerbating economic hardships. Smuggling not only deprives the nation of vital revenue but also facilitates the influx of illicit goods, compromising the safety and well-being of citizens. The unbridled flow of smuggled merchandise in our country undermines legitimate businesses, leading to job losses and economic instability. Sadly, they are all backed up by corrupt politicians. I wonder and reflect on our current leadership. I am sorry about our decision. Who are the leaders that we have? Are they able to establish their priorities by comprehending the historical background of our country? And if so, what are they doing? They contributed to the ranking of our nation as the poorest nation on earth.  Unemployment and the exodus of youth With corruption strangling the economy, job opportunities dwindle, leaving a significant portion of the  population grappling with unemployment . The youth, yearning for a brighter future, are disillusioned and compelled to seek opportunities abroad. The exodus of youthful talent weakens the nation’s potential for innovation and progress, resulting in a brain drain that impedes development. According to the  Department of Foreign Employment  (DoFE), as many as 3,327 Nepali young people go abroad each day to work. In the darkness of extreme frustration and unemployment,  remittance emerges as a beacon of hope . The toil and sacrifice of the diaspora keep the economy afloat, providing crucial foreign currency and supporting families back home. However, this  reliance on remittance comes with its own set of risks , as economic fluctuations abroad can impact the stability of the nation’s economy.  Sociologist Alejandro Portes, a Cuban-American, has drawn attention to the negative effects that remittances may have, such as encouraging dependency, impeding local entrepreneurship, and promoting a culture of dependence rather than self-sufficiency. Kleptocracies loom large Niccolò Machiavelli believed that it was “impossible for a corrupted people to set up a good government, or for a tyranny to be introduced if they are virtuous.” We are drowning in the pit of darkness because of the  Kleptocracies.  Our democracy is having its clothes taken off. By actively participating in the democratic process and resolving any weaknesses or vulnerabilities it may have, citizens can play a critical role in preserving and enhancing the democratic system. The naked democracy needs to be dressed up. The best course of action is to start looking for alternative possibilities. The requirement is citizens need to be critical. The first step in  developing critical thinking  is to let go of our preconceived notions about any political party. People need to engage in constructive dialogue, uphold the rule of law, and support laws and policies that enhance justice, equality, and the common good.  Corruption Perception Index  (CPI), an endeavour of six different international organisations,  Nepal placed in the 110th positio n by receiving 34 points out of 180 countries. The Kleptocracy must be abolished. International images and geopolitical trials As corruption and mismanagement persist, the nation’s international standing weakens. The once-promising impact on the global stage diminishes, leaving the nation vulnerable to external pressures and challenges.  Geopolitical interests, once aligned with the nation’s progress, now seek to exploit its vulnerabilities, further convoluting the path towards growth and development. Unfortunately, we are citizens of a country whose leaders have forgotten their heritage and tarnished the country’s image internationally. Sponsored leadership does not actually perform realistic assessments based on the historical context. They fish in troubled waters for the sponsor. They backed their agendas including, among others, calls for reducing security personnel and  ratification of MCC . Failure to uphold a meritocratic culture The nation finds itself engulfed in an impenetrable shroud of darkness, a web of corruption, nepotism, and favouritism. It further deepens the abyss, as meritocracy and talent are relegated to the backseat in pivotal appointments and decision-making processes.  The time has come for a united front to confront these insidious forces. Our leaders must acknowledge the profound repercussions of their choices and shift their focus to the well-being of the populace. By reinstating clarity, nurturing a system of meritocracy, and empowering the next generation, the nation can forge an illuminated path towards prosperity and reclaim its eminent position on the global stage.  The moment has arrived to ignite the flickering flame of democracy and eradicate the looming darkness that menaces the future of our land. Cronyism undermines the potential for progress, ushering in a system where connections, rather than competence, determine one’s trajectory. As deserving individuals are marginalised, the nation’s capacity for growth is strangled. Uprooting nepotism and favouritism fosters a culture of meritocracy, where talent and competence are duly rewarded. By granting equal opportunities to all citizens, regardless of their background, the nation can harness the full potential of its human capital. Confronting unemployment and youth migration To stem the tide of youth migration, the nation must focus on creating sustainable employment prospects. Investments in education, skills development, and entrepreneurship can empower the youth to become catalysts of change within their homeland.  Reducing reliance on remittance calls for diversifying the economy. Encouraging investments in various sectors, promoting innovation, and supporting small and medium enterprises can forge a resilient economy that is less susceptible to external shocks. However, the signs of democratic governance in the system are dead because politicians lack ethics, conduct, and a way of life. This poses a significant challenge to the health and integrity of democracy. Unhealthy democratic values lead to a loss of public trust in the democratic process and institutions.  To dissipate the darkness that engulfs the nation, transparency and accountability must be reinstated. Leaders must be held to a loftier standard, and answerable to the citizens they serve. Fortifying institutions and upholding the rule of law are pivotal strides towards curbing corruption and nepotism while safeguarding democracy.",political

Instability in the finance secretary role impacting the country’s economic sector,"With Krishna Hari Pushkar’s appointment on September 15, the  Ministry of Finance  has seen five different finance secretaries in the past 18 months, with three being replaced since Prakash Sharan Mahat assumed office as the finance minister. During economic crises, the Ministry of Finance plays a crucial role in managing and stabilising the country’s economy. However, akin to a game of musical chairs, government employees tasked with the responsibility of maintaining economic balance are often shifted or replaced. Arjun Prasad Pokharel served as the finance secretary before Pushkar assumed the position. Prior to Pokharel’s appointment on May 3, Toyam Raya held the role for approximately four months. Pushkar initially held the position of finance secretary before Raya was appointed to the role. Furthermore, when the then Finance Minister Janardan Sharma presented the budget for the  fiscal year 2022/23 , Madhu Marasini, who held the position of finance secretary, was reassigned due to his  involvement in a controversy surrounding the alteration of tax rates  in the budget, attributed to the entry of unauthorised individuals. Subsequently, Pushkar, who assumed office on August 11, 2022, was succeeded by Raya on January 5. Flawed approach This is not an anomaly, as similar incidents have been occurring regularly over the past decade. “The secretary is an important figure. I don’t think they should be transferred this often. They should remain in office for at least two years,” said former Chief Secretary Bimal Koirala. “Following that, an evaluation can be done to decide if their term should be extended.” Things were different in the past, says Koirala. He mentions that individuals appointed as finance secretaries would typically retire from government service while holding that position. “The stability of the finance secretary was a beautiful aspect of the Ministry of Finance,” says Koirala who has served as the finance secretary himself. “I think we need to give some stability to the post.” The Ministry of Finance is widely regarded as the most pivotal ministry in the country. Responsible for overseeing all government income and expenditures, it also guides the operations and services of other ministries and agencies. Former administrators underscore the critical importance of a robust Ministry of Finance, as the effectiveness and efficiency of other ministries hinge on its resilience. Other ministries also look to the Ministry of Finance with anticipation, recognising it as the guardian of the country’s treasury. This is why all secretaries within the Nepal government hold the same rank, yet there exists a tradition of affording special respect to the finance secretary. It is commonplace for secretaries from various ministries and agencies to turn to the finance secretary to resolve procedural complexities. By this, it is clear that the finance secretary holds a position of utmost significance among secretaries and is second only to the chief secretary, owing to the perception that they possess exceptional abilities and a high level of professional insight. Except for Narkanta Adhikari, who was transferred after a tenure of about six months during the Panchayat period, all the finance secretaries had completed their tenure. Even after the establishment of multi-party democracy, the post of finance secretary was considered relatively stable for a long time. Civil service experts say that after the resignation of  Rameshore Khanal , the post of finance secretary has become unstable. Finance secretaries like Rameshwar Khanal, Bidyadhar Mallik, Bimal Koirala, Ramsharan Bhattarai, Thakur Nath Pant, and others are still held in high regard as symbols of prestige within the Ministry of Finance. “Now the principle of requiring honesty seems to have been abandoned. We’re in a situation where finance secretaries are appointed based on word of mouth,” says a former secretary. Minister’s preference Rameshore Khanal resigned due to differences with then-finance minister Bharat Mohan Adhikari. After that, the process of appointing financial secretaries started to be guided by the minister’s discretion. “This situation has come about because the political leadership is afraid that a professional individual might take an independent stance and not simply follow orders that would potentially disrupt the legal proceedings,” says former secretary Gopinath Mainali. Former secretaries also believe that one of the reasons for economic issues in Nepal stems from not appointing the right person as the finance secretary. They argue that during economic turmoil, hasty decisions can lead to adverse outcomes. “If Pushkar does not leave the Ministry of Finance in around four months, the economy will deteriorate further which will lead to Mahat’s having to resign,” says a former secretary. Given that ministerial positions are political appointments, there is no assurance that an individual with a deep understanding of the economy will assume the role of finance minister. That is where the finance secretary comes in. “Capacity, professionalism and stability are very important characteristics that a finance secretary needs to have,” says Rameshore Khanal. “The practice of randomly changing finance secretaries is not only uncommon in developed countries but also in most SAARC nations. Therefore, it should not be a prevailing practice in our country either.” Former administrators suggest that the economy would not have suffered significantly if a proactive finance secretary had served for the entire term. They believe that if the finance secretary had taken timely action to withdraw the financial concessions granted to the private sector in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, the economy would not be facing the same challenges it is today. “Decisions taken by the Board of Directors of the Nepal Rastra Bank, which is represented by the finance secretary, have also become a factor in the economy’s problems”, says a former secretary. “The act of inciting the finance minister against the governor, coupled with the unbalanced role of the finance secretary who lacks the authority to address the NRB’s board, has contributed to the current situation.” Lack of financial knowledge Anyone who has qualifications in any area and is efficient can be in the civil service. However, to be the financial secretary one should have knowledge of economics and should have worked in agencies under the Ministry of Finance. Nevertheless, this practice is no longer followed, which has an adverse effect on Nepal’s economy. The finance secretary serves as Nepal’s representative during interactions with donor agencies. This is why many experts believe they need to be a person of sound judgment, capable of articulating the country’s economic standing and potential on the global stage. Former secretaries recall that in earlier times, the private sector used to approach the finance secretary with a degree of circumspection. The present situation is different. The finance minister no longer prioritises the selection of competent, efficient, and honest employees. They now lean towards a secretary who is compliant and flexible, straying from the traditional criteria for selecting an effective finance secretary within the Ministry of Finance. For example, Suman Sharma, an engineer with expertise in drinking water, was given the opportunity to serve as the finance secretary. Former Chief Secretary Lokdarshan Regmi, who also held the position of finance secretary, along with Arjun Pokharel, who was recently reassigned, do not have a background in finance. There are numerous instances of such secretaries over the course of a decade. On the contrary, Dr Baikuntha Aryal, the current chief secretary who was viewed as a qualified and skilled candidate for the position of finance secretary, was not appointed to the position. Likewise, Kewal Prasad Bhandari, who is about to retire has been sent to the Ministry of Labour. The Ministry of Finance is where regular citizens, party leaders and activists, lawmakers, and businesspeople seek budgets and plans. Nowadays, businesspeople are taking their policy concerns from the Ministry of Finance directly to the Prime Minister. “In the past, industrialists used to raise their demands and issues with the finance secretary, now they are approaching the prime minister even with small issues,” says a former secretary. Khanal says that in other countries, it is not customary to reassign a person once they have been appointed as the finance secretary unless there are significant allegations of corruption involved. “All development and good governance policies revolve around the periphery of the economic policy. If the economic policy administrator becomes unstable, other policies will be affected”, says Khanal. “That’s why many countries have given importance to the stability of the finance secretary.” He emphasises that if the role of the finance secretary is rendered weak and unstable, it will not only lower the morale of the private sector but also disrupt relationships with key development stakeholders.

NRNs can apply for Nepali citizenship from abroad,"Kathmandu, September 21 Non-resident Nepalis (NRNs) will be able to apply the Nepali citizenship from abroad. The  third amendment of the citizenship regulation made recently by the government  has allowed NRNs to apply for their citizenship from embassies or consulates abroad. Nepalis living abroad, however, will have to submit an application to the chief district officer of the district from where their father, mother or grandfather obtained their citizenship from. To acquire non-resident Nepali citizenship, applicants must provide a copy of their current foreign passport, a pledge to uphold the  Constitution of Nepal , evidence of their foreign citizenship, and other necessary documentation.  Individuals residing in  SAARC countries  are ineligible for NRN citizenship. Once an NRN submits the application, the Nepali Embassy or consulate general is responsible for forwarding the application to the respective chief district officer within 15 days. Upon receiving the application, the chief district officer must verify the identity of the non-resident Nepali with the assistance of a Nepali citizen. If the chief district officer has doubts about the foreign citizenship and passport submitted by the NRN, he can ask the relevant embassy or consulate general to check the validity. In this way, if a request for a validity check is received, the embassy or consulate general should investigate and inform the district within 15 days. Before granting an NRN citizenship, the chief district officer has to make take an oath to obey the constitution and laws of Nepal. By obtaining Nepali citizenship, NRNs will find it easier to invest in Nepal along with owning properties. They can also engage in other social and cultural activities. The citizenship, however, will not allow the NRNs any political rights. This means those who have both international and Nepali citizenship will not be allowed to vote, contest an election or hold government posts.",political

Nepal’s ‘regressive’ education bill stirs debate and deliberation,"After eight years since the promulgation of the constitution, the government introduced a  bill to amend and integrate laws related to education  in the  House of Representatives  on September 13. In a reversal of the decision made by the Council of Ministers on May 30, a bill registered at the parliament secretariat stipulates that private schools will no longer be required to operate under a Guthi (Board of Trustees). This marks a significant shift from the earlier directive, which mandated private schools to come under the purview of a Guthi within a five-year period. Before the education bill was officially registered in parliament, private school operators had declared their intention to protest against it. In response to their threat to halt classes, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal announced on August 10 that the decision previously made by the Council of Ministers had been reversed. During the discussions with ministers regarding the working agreement, Dahal pointed out that there have been substantial alterations in the Federal Education Act. Numerous subjects have undergone revisions, some of which appear to have a more negative impact. One step forward, two steps back One of the regressive changes in the education bill was the removal of the provision that mandated schools to operate under Guthi within a five-year timeframe. As per sub-section 3 of section 4 of the act, schools that were established and functioning in accordance with the existing company law at the time of this act’s commencement have the option to convert and operate as Guthi.  This signifies that the decision to operate a school under the Guthi system is at the discretion of the school operators. They have the flexibility to continue teaching for an indefinite period, charging a fee set by the local level. “If this education bill is passed, the constitution should be amended,” says Bal Chandra Luitel, dean at Kathmandu University School of Education.  Luitel argues that the provision permitting private schools to collect fees contradicts the constitutionally mandated rights to compulsory and free education. “The spirit of the constitution and provision in the education bill do not match with each other. That is why the constitution should be amended if this bill is passed,” he says. According to Article 31, basic-level education is mandatory, and secondary-level education should be provided for free. The constitution also ensures the right to education in one’s native language. However, the bill stipulates that the language of instruction for mathematics, science, and computer science should be English. Luitel argues that this is an extremely detrimental proposal. “While studies show that the students can understand the content easily if they are taught in their native language, the bill is against it.”   No politics, please! The bill has granted official recognition to the Nepal Teachers’ Federation, but it has simultaneously prohibited teachers from engaging in political activities. As per the bill, teachers will face dismissal from their positions if they are discovered to be members of political parties or engaged in any form of political activity. The federation, however, is a political organisation in itself which has confused many on what the bill actually is trying to do. According to educationist Bidyanath Koirala, the inclusion of a provision for establishing a fraternal organisation of political parties in the education bill was not a primary focus of the education reform. He believes it was added by the government to appease political parties. The office bearers of the federation say that they are disappointed with many of the points in the education bill. They say the education bill has violated the trade union rights of teachers and excluded Montessori from the school’s structure.   “We are preparing a protest against the bill,” says Kamala Tuladhar, president of the federation. Silver lining On the other hand, the school staff appear to be content with the education bill. Shantinath Yogi, the general secretary of the Nepal School Staff Council, expresses satisfaction, noting that the bill has addressed the majority of their demands. Earlier, school employees protested, requesting a guaranteed minimum monthly salary of Rs 26,210. They also called for the adjustment of public school employees in their current positions, with a one-time automatic transition to permanent status. The bill has proposed that the rank of public school staff will be determined according to national standards. Additionally, the Teachers Service Commission will conduct examinations for both teachers and staff. It has been arranged that the appointment of school staff recommended by the commission will be done at the local level and the arrangement regarding the salary, service, conditions and facilities of the school staff will be based on the law of the local level. “In the current bill few things have been missed but most of our demands have been addressed,” Yogi told Onlinekhabar. “We will have no complaint if this bill will be passed.” This story was translated from  the original Nerapali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Deep-rooted ordinance abuse eroding Nepal’s parliamentary system raising concerns over system integrity,"A study conducted by the Parliament Secretariat revealed that bypassing the Parliament and issuing ordinances for the sake of power has been rooted deeply within Nepal. The study has said the parliamentary system and its integrity are being questioned as a whole when given that the executives have exploited the exemption provided by the constitution to address specific tasks immediately during the parliamentary recess. The  Parliamentary Studies and Research Section  under the Federal Parliament Secretariat recently published ‘Ordinances in Nepal: Report on System and Practice ( 2022 )’.  “The report highlights a recurring trend of attempting to influence and govern through ordinances in Nepal.” The report has noted that there is a recurring trend of leaders trying to govern the country by bringing in ordinances. The report mentions the period following King Gyanendra’s direct rule in 2002 and the  two instances  of Parliament dissolution in  2020  and  2021 . The study concludes that ordinances issued in 2020 and 2021, coupled with modifications to legal frameworks and instances of malpractice, have raised serious doubts about the integrity of the ordinance system itself. Learning from history In Nepal’s constitutional history, ordinances have been consistently issued since 1959. After 1959, five ordinances were issued in  1960 , including three concerning taxation, and two in 1961. However, the then-King Mahendra, under the Panchayat system, abolished the government and declared a coup, replacing the democratic system. Following this, the  Panchayat Constitution of 1962  was promulgated, leading to the issuance of 64 ordinances on various dates until 1990. After the abolition of the Panchayat system and the restoration of the democratic system with a monarch, a new constitution was promulgated. Even in the Constitution of Nepal (1990), the provision for the issuance of ordinances remained intact.  A total of 182 ordinances were issued until 2006, with 30 ordinances issued between 1990 to 2002. This period marked the institutionalisation of the multi-party democracy system and the emergence of the  Maoist revolution . The inclination to issue ordinances significantly escalated after King Gyanendra assumed direct rule. In 2003, 27 ordinances were issued, followed by 33 the next year, and a remarkable 79 ordinances in the year following that. Following the People’s Movement of 2006, the 240-year monarchy came to an end, and along with it, the interim constitution of 2007 was introduced while the new constitution was being drafted. However, the misuse of ordinances did not stop, and by the time the new constitution was promulgated in 2015, a total of 39 ordinances had been issued. After 2015, no ordinances were issued in the years 2015, 2016, and 2019, while three ordinances were issued in 2017 and five in 2018, indicating a slight decrease in the frequency. In 2020, 11 ordinances were issued, whereas the number rose to 28 in 2021. The two attempts at dissolution of the House of Representatives – on December 20, 2020, and May 22, 2021–led to a significant surge in the number of ordinances issued during that period. However, the reinstatement of the parliament led to a decrease, with only two being issued in 2022. But interestingly, only a small fraction of the ordinances turned into laws. The study revealed that, after 2015, even though 49 were issued within five years following the first elections, only 17 of these ordinances have been converted into laws. After the 2022 elections, an ordinance was issued on May 3, the government issued an ordinance to amend the  practice of usury . Use for political gain The primary responsibility of the Parliament is to enact legislation, which is why it is often referred to as the legislature. According to the constitution, when Parliament is not in session, the executive branch can exercise legislative authority to issue ordinances for the immediate establishment of legal arrangements, only under special circumstances. There is a constitutional provision that empowers the incumbent President to issue an ordinance based on the government’s recommendation and present it during the first session of Parliament after its resumption. As per the provision, the ordinance must be converted into law through a replacement bill within 60 days of its being submitted to the Parliament. Otherwise, the ordinance will be dismissed. Regrettably, though, the prime ministers and the political parties in Nepal have frequently abused this. There have been instances of lawmakers deliberately ending the ongoing sessions prematurely and even making attempts to dissolve the Parliament itself just to facilitate and expedite the issuing of the ordinances. Whether it was regarding this year’s  budget announcement  or splitting  political parties , several ordinances were used to facilitate political manoeuvring for power. The ordinance for Nepal Citizenship Act ( 2006 ) was issued on May 23, 2021, a day after the Parliament was dissolved  at midnight . On June 11, 2021, the Supreme Court stopped the implementation of the ordinance and stated that if this practice is seen as normal, it could violate the Constitution by overstepping the powers of the legislature and interfering with the  separation of powers . This might lead to an unfair application of constitutional rules, it said. The recent report has pointed out that adjourning or dissolving the Parliament during its regular session for the sake of issuing ordinances is not in line with principles of good governance and  democratic rule . In the report, the events were defined as the results of political gains and losses. It further analysed that ordinances have been issued based on two distinct tendencies–to address  vested interest  or as a tool for governance. However, the report also recognises the importance of ordinances used to amend laws about  sexual violence ,  acid attacks , and other severe criminal acts, especially in cases where the Parliament was not in session. The report concludes that such measures were necessary at the time. Persistent approach to ordinances Other issues raised by the report were regarding the recurring practice of pushing the same ordinance multiple times. Under the leadership of former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the same ordinance was enacted on four separate occasions: “It appears that, though in alignment with the essence and principles of the constitutional system, the government repeatedly introduces these ordinances without taking them through the parliamentary process to become laws,” stated the report adding how the practice mirrors the governmental practice. Although the study has subtly implied the message, it can be understood that Nepal’s governance system has often been at odds with the prevalent constitution. The study has raised questions about the Ordinance on Constitutional Council Act at various points. Questions were raised because, as per the said ordinance, it was outlined that just three people could be present in the Constitutional Council. This resulted in 32 individuals being recommended for appointment to various constitutional bodies in a Constitutional Council meeting that sat on December 15, 2020.  More questions were raised because just five days later, the incumbent government dissolved the House of Representatives, and the appointees were subsequently approved without undergoing parliamentary hearings. Notably, it drew international scrutiny  regarding the status  of the National Human Rights Commission, a constitutional body. The issue reached the Supreme Court, and the appointments made were under review. However, the same ordinance was reissued the second time. Based on this, other 20 officials were  recommended . Again, against the constitutional provision, they  were appointed  without a hearing by the Parliamentary Hearing Special Commission, as the House of Representatives was dissolved on May 22, 2021. Writ petitions challenging both of these events of appointments are currently under review in the Supreme Court. The report, in retrospect, has advised that the legislative should consider a democratic system when introducing ordinances. It further warns, “If the misuse of the authority to issue ordinances persists, there is a risk of increasing autocracy in governance.”  It also suggests, “There should be a high degree of consensus among political parties concerning ordinances, to put an end to the political practice of opposing or hastily issuing ordinances as per their convenience.” 11 budget announcements through ordinances After the introduction of democracy in 1951, the tradition of presenting the budget to Parliament began. A year later, the practice of announcing the budget also started. Over these 72 years, many budgets have been deliberated and approved by Parliament while the government has also resorted to ordinances to pass the budget. According to the report, there have been 11 such occasions in Nepal to date. Upon the restoration of democracy, then-Finance Minister Devendra Raj Pandey presented the budget for the fiscal year 1990/91 to the Prime Minister on July 13, 1990. Other budget announcements via an ordinance were made for the fiscal years 1994/95, 2002/03, 2003/04, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2010/11, 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2021/22. The instances hint that the elected representatives often implement ordinances without parliamentary discussion. This has been true even in matters as significant as setting and collecting taxes. It is understood that taxation forms a vital foundation for running a country. Even though it is fundamentally recognised in the parliamentary system that it should and must be as per the laws set by elected representatives. As per the constitution, all three tiers of government should have well-defined provisions, as per the law, about the taxes they impose. Case of judicial oversight Experts argue that the arbitrary practice of issuing ordinances, be it on any subject, runs counter to the principle of the separation of powers, represents governmental or administrative arbitrariness, and contravenes the constitutional framework governing ordinances. Advocate Raju Prasad Chapagain, a former chair of the Constitutional Lawyers’ Forum, revises that there has been rampant misuse of ordinances, even during the implementation of the current constitution since 1991. He characterises this situation as a lack of effective judicial control. “The government often issues ordinances for its interest rather than need. And, in some cases, once an ordinance has been used, it is revoked without presenting a replacement bill to Parliament,” says Chapagain. “In the absence of effective judicial oversight, and when the court does not maintain control over such matters, it amounts to a recurring misuse of the constitution and imposes a breach of constitutional ethics.” Meanwhile, senior advocate Chandra Kanta Gyawali regards the recurrent practice of issuing ordinances, as a violation of the Constitution.  “The meaning of ordinances is becoming arbitrary,” says Gyawali. Gyawali underscores the need for the Supreme Court to clarify the boundaries and constraints of ordinances. If not addressed, he warns, the pattern of undermining the values and dignity of the Parliament is likely to persist.

Cooperatives reform taskforce unveils key findings and recommendations,"Kathmandu, September 15 The Cooperative Sector Reforms Recommendation Taskforce, 2023, has submitted its report, suggesting the short-term, mid-term and long-term measures to address the challenges surfaced in the country’s  cooperative sector .  The government had formed the taskforce on May 9. The task force suggests that if a loan surpasses 10 percent of the total amount allocated to an individual or household, it should be resolved within a span of six months. Similarly, members of the board of directors, audit committee, and management who belong to the same household or are close relatives should be separated within a three-month period. This is due to the potential impact on services resulting from the conflict of interest involving such individuals. The taskforce has also recommended that the transformation of investment of the cooperatives into different companies, mart and apartments should be managed into the liquid property within a year. Furthermore, the cooperatives which failed to pay back the depositors should pay them even by transforming the other sectors’ investment and fixed assets of the founders. The cooperatives should formulate their detailed plans of action on risk management and inform their regulatory body and central association. The study taskforce has suggested that the passports of the responsible office-bearers and those involved in the management body should be kept on hold if the depositors’ collection was embezzled. The taskforce has also recommended clearance of the financial transaction, lending, saving and loan imbursement within the parallel organisations within a year. Frequent monitoring of the cooperative as well as feedback and reward and punishment are recommended by the taskforce. The taskforce has concluded that shifting the investment by the cooperatives that are run by the family members towards real estate, apartment, stores and different other companies has caused problem in the cooperative organisation at present. Consultations and regular meetings among the board of directors and management team of the cooperative as well as regular information dissemination is also suggested to ensure transparency of the organisations. National Planning Commission  Member Jaykant Raut led the taskforce with Secretary at the  Ministry of Land Management, Cooperative and Poverty Alleviation  Gokarna Mani Duwadi, Problematic Cooperatives Management Committee Chairman Kashi Raj Dahal and others as its members.",political
Lawmakers’ inadequacy continues to hinder Nepal’s parliamentary committee,"During the first official meeting of parliamentary committee chairpersons on August 30, Speaker Dev Raj Ghimire and Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar brought up the issue of implementing the decisions made at the parliament. During the meeting, the chair of the Agriculture, Cooperative, and Natural Resources Committee, Arzu Rana stated how she had held discussions with previous chairs who told her how the government rarely acted on the decisions made by the committee. The chair of the Industry and Commerce and Labour and Consumer Welfare Committee Abdul Khan also had discussions with several former committee chairs. He said that they expressed similar concerns, and this has left him disheartened. “What is the point when the decisions we make are not implemented? What is our role,” he said in the meeting. This issue has been made clear by a recently released study –  Parliamentary Monitoring Tools and Practices of Nepal . The study mentions that lawmakers themselves are the reason why decisions made by parliamentary committees are not implemented. The study’s findings suggest that the effectiveness of the parliamentary committees hinges on the capabilities of its members. With Nepal’s parliament not implementing decisions made by the committee members, which is led by astute parliamentarians, the study has raised an important question – How capable are our lawmakers?  What do the reports show? On November 17, 2021, a five-member study committee was formed under the coordination of Sudarshan Khadka, secretary of the Federal Parliament Secretariat. The committee studied the parliamentary monitoring tools in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and India and the methods practised by Nepal since 1959. The report clearly states that a substantial number of instructions issued by parliamentary committees to the government have not been put into practice. That said, it does add that the current committees should be more effective than the previous committees. This is not the first time this has been highlighted. The annual reports of the parliamentary committees have time and again stated the lack of implementation of the decisions taken by the parliamentary committees. According to its study, there are three reasons why the instructions of the parliamentary committees are not being implemented in Nepal. The first barrier hindering the implementation of committee instructions lies in their foundation on insufficiently researched objectives. The second factor is the absence of proper coordination and extensive deliberation with pertinent stakeholders, intellectuals, and researchers before issuing these instructions. The third challenge arises from irregularities in monitoring the execution of decisions. Contrary to this, the Parliamentary Monitoring Tools and Practices of Nepal report presents a different perspective. The report underscores internal factors as the primary cause for the committees’ diminished effectiveness. It places responsibility on both bureaucrats and lawmakers who are members of the committee. Additionally, the report notes that the committee often deviates from its designated agenda and fails to adhere to prescribed mandates and procedures. According to the study, one contributing factor to the committee’s struggles is that their scope of work is determined by the regulations of the House of Representatives. These regulations define their jurisdiction and outline their actions, which can sometimes limit their operational flexibility. Another complicating factor is that various committees may deliberate on the same issue, resulting in different sets of recommendations. This diversity of suggestions can hinder effective implementation. Committee members are also often led by or dominated by the ruling parties. This means these people will mostly defend the work of the government which has made implementing decisions even harder. Subsequently, questions have been raised about the competence of the lawmakers and parliament employees. One of the identified reasons for the diminished effectiveness of parliamentary committees is the “lack of knowledge, skills, and abilities of committee members (lawmakers) and secretariat employees.”  Additionally, the report highlights another critical issue — the insufficient allocation of material, financial, and human resources to the committee. These factors collectively contribute to the committees’ reduced effectiveness. The study emphasised intensive monitoring, evaluation on site, suggestions and instructions for improvement for the works that are carried out as per the annual budget and programmes by the government agencies. It has been emphasised that the work carried out according to the annual budget and program by the government agencies should be intensively monitored and evaluated on-site and suggestions and instructions should be given as needed for improvement. What are the problems in committees? The study has pointed out that there is a tendency to ignore jurisdiction among parliamentary committees and they do so to gain popularity among the public. An example of that can be how various committees wanted to be involved in the Kathmandu-Tarai fast track issue, the Covid issue and the border diple issue. The committees had their discussions on the issue and gave instructions without knowing if they could do so or how their decision would be implemented. Another problem that the study shows is committees being ignorant of on-site monitoring. It states on-site monitoring efforts fell short of expectations due to several factors. These include inadequate preparation before embarking on the monitoring visit, rushing through the monitoring process, an inability to establish a consistent monitoring routine, and a failure to engage in comprehensive discussions with all relevant stakeholders. These shortcomings collectively contributed to the suboptimal outcomes of the on-site monitoring. Lack of coordination between committees and relevant stakeholders is another issue, says the study. Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary at the Parliament Secretariat questions the practice of selecting the leadership of parliamentary committees.  “The committee chair should be selected based on ability but most are chosen based on the parties they represent. This will never allow the committee to be run smoothly,” said Thapa. Thapa says most lawmakers go to these meetings without research. These lawmakers then ask irrelevant questions wasting everyone’s time and making it difficult for all involved. “Only 30 per cent of those who are part of these committees are well-learned. The rest argue with no knowledge,” says Thapa. “If everyone was capable and came prepared for these meetings, things would be a lot different.” How to improve? To improve the situation, the study suggests that the parliamentary committees should make an annual calendar to carry out the tasks under their respective jurisdictions. It adds that in the case of an emergency, the parliamentary committee should proceed only after ascertaining whether the subject matter is within the jurisdiction of its committee or not, to avoid any duplicity. Former General Secretary of Parliament Secretariat Surya Kiran Gurung says that the leaders of the parliamentary sub-committees should lead from the front and be in the know about the issue they are tackling. “The recent electricity bill was a good example of how clueless our lawmakers are. They did not address the things that needed addressing which shows how ignorant they are,” said Gurung. Gurung says whoever is in the leading role should be able to have the mindset to listen to criticism and move forward with it.

Bill to amend and integrate laws related to education registered in the Hosue,"Kathmandu, September 13 After a long wait, the government registered the Bill to amend and integrate laws related to education in the  House of Representatives  on Wednesday. Following approval from the Council of Ministers, the Bill concerning the effective administration of schools, including the formulation of national standards for their establishment and operations, has been officially registered.  Subsequently, the Bill is available on the  website of the Federal Parliament Secretariat . The Bill aims to establish clear and transparent guidelines for school management. Private investment schools will need local-level approval for both their establishment and the addition of classes. Furthermore, private schools will be permitted to levy fees within the boundaries and subjects specified by the local level. Public schools, on the other hand, will not be allowed to charge fees. Newly established private schools will operate under the Guthi (Board of Trustees) while existing private schools will not be compelled to do so. The Chairperson of the school management committee will be chosen from among the parents. Additionally, provisions have been made to cater to the needs of school employees.",political
Why are bureaucrats shying away from making decisions?,"The Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation declined to publish a notice in the  Nepal Gazette , stating that the decision to auction land made during the meeting of the  Council of Ministers  on April 17 was unclear and incomplete. Due to the lack of interest from the then Chief Secretary,  Shanker Das Bairagi , in clarifying or verifying the confusion, the decision remained unimplemented for nearly four months. On August 10, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal questioned the Council why the decision had not been implemented during a meeting. During the meeting, Dahal made a sharp comment and questioned why the secretary was not following or implementing the cabinet decision arbitrarily. During the meeting, additional decisions were made, and the amendment to the  Land Use Regulations  (2022) was initiated. The old decision has now begun to be implemented this month. Nepal’s bureaucrats continue to hold power to implement decisions made by the government. However, due to the prejudice of these bureaucrats and the influence of intermediaries, there have been countless incidents where these decisions have not been implemented. Series of indecisiveness by bureaucrats  The cabinet’s decision, on July 5, to extend the contracts of ailing projects is yet to come into effect. The contractors have given their applications, however, the President of the Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal ( FCAN ) Rabi Singh says, “The problem is that the authorities are not ready to take responsibility for the projects or extend the deadlines as per the cabinet’s decision.” On January 25, a cabinet meeting decided to allow the crusher industry to pay the due fees and taxes, to renew their license that was pending due to the renewed standards. However, district-level offices of small and cottage industries did not heed. They deferred the renewal of the crusher industry, citing that the cabinet decision was unclear and not a strong enough reason. In the  budget for the current fiscal year , the government announced to either dismiss and/or merge or restructure 21 entities including institutes, committees, boards, etc. The relevant ministries are still undecided on the matter of transferring and distributing their assets and liabilities. A secretary-level meeting, on July 17, decided to proceed with the process immediately and collect concrete evidence in coordination with the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration ( MoFAGA ) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The Finance Ministry will submit a comprehensive draft to the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers ( OPMCM ) by mid-August.  However, due to pressure from various interest groups and complications arising from dissatisfaction with the management, bureaucrats at the Finance Ministry have not made a decision. Therefore, the secretary meeting, on August 21, decided that a decision should be made on this matter by mid-September. Administrative and constitutional expert, Kashi Raj Dahal, asserts that when a government employee or bureaucrat refuses to execute tasks within their designated jurisdiction or evades decision-making, it should be deemed as a wrongful action. Nevertheless, he says that the absence of a monitoring body has resulted in a state of confusion. According to Dahal, before the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority ( CIAA ) used to take action against any wrongdoings–ranging from bureaucrats. From not making decisions within their jurisdictions to making decisions unfairly, any wrongdoing was punished. However, for the past eight years, no government employee has faced legal action for improper actions.  “Someone must undertake the task of investigating and instructing as well as taking action against the wrongdoings,” says Dahal. “When decisions are made beyond one’s authority or not as per one’s responsibilities, the suspended time of action increases with significant delays in implementation.” Scepticism runs high Recently, during the PM’s National Development Problem Solving Committee  meeting , PM Dahal expressed concern that ministers, secretaries, and staff were refraining from making decisions for fear of landing in controversies or  court cases . On August 10, after putting forward his discontentment, he also pushed for prompt action to rectify the government’s inclination to avoid taking risks in the decision-making process and to demonstrate a commitment to upholding the law. However, PM Dahal’s words have failed to persuade the employees and the officials are seeing the same results.  A recent example of this is the ongoing  Tinkune  compensation dispute. According to sources, after Balen Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu metropolitan city, brought their attention to resolve the dispute over Tinkune  compensation delays , PM Dahal instructed the concerned ministries to expedite its resolution. However, the District Administration Office has been unwilling to acquire the land as per the new valuation given the land had been nationalised without distributing compensation. But this has resulted in Kathmandu metropolis’ plan for Tinkune to be halted. Meanwhile, the officials are concerned about landing in a similar controversy to the  Lalita Niwas land case , if they give compensation for the already-acquired land. An official from the PM’s office shares, “Even decisions that involve little to no risks are being forwarded to the cabinet for the final decision.” Due to the legal framework, which prohibits the CIAA from investigating decisions made by the cabinet, matters that could potentially be contentious are being referred to the Council of Ministers. Recently, a proposal for an annual maintenance contract regarding the National Identity Card Management Information System/Procedure has also been submitted to the cabinet. The contract was supposed to be signed last year, however, the contractor has been working without payment for a year. Currently, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and the Department of National ID and Civil Registration (DNCR) are striving to secure a decision from the cabinet regarding the agreement.  Recently, ministers have been reporting to the prime minister that it has been difficult to appoint the head in offices where any kind of sensitive decisions are to be taken.  For the past month, the Department of Transport Management (DoTM) does not have a director general. According to sources, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport ( MoPIT ) attempted to assign a Director General, but the available joint secretaries have not agreed to take the responsibility. The official adds, “Various decisions like the  smart license cards , maintenance contracts for various systems, and contracts for producing embossed number plates are still pending, and they all carry a degree of risk, resulting in hesitation.” What is the problem? On the other hand, the news broke out that  Chief Secretary Baikuntha Aryal  has been summoned to give a statement to the CIAA regarding the  national payment gateway deal . It has heightened hesitation within the bureaucracy. An incumbent secretary shares the situation is turning grave because the few officials who made risky decisions have been made to admit guilt while the government has not made attempts to protect the individuals. Speaking further, the secretary shares how secretary Krishna Bahadur Raut, who was recently implicated in the Lalita Niwas land case, was allowed to continue in his position whereas the Chief District Officer of Dang, Sushil Vaidya, also implicated in the same case, is suffering.  The secretary says, “Given the discriminatory political trend, who would be willing to make decisions and jeopardise their career?” A deputy director general from the Department of Road says, “Even when we make decisions following the directives from the higher-ups, we find ourselves in a situation where we may end up in jail or have to deal with legal repercussions.” Former secretary  Sharda Prasad Trital  expresses frustration with the practice of shielding political leaders who make erroneous decisions. “It’s unreasonable for those who simply follow orders to be deemed guilty while the leaders who ask us to make the decisions escape the music. They should share equal accountability,” says Trital. Trital further asserts that even honest employees land have been landing in such controversies, hence, everyone is now hesitant to spearhead any decisions and prefers to delay the process. He emphasises though that employees should not feel hesitant to voice their opinions on whether a decision aligns with the law or not and whether it is correct or not. “And if there is disagreement, the leadership should decide who is correct,” says Trital. Former election commission secretary Gopinath Mainali voices the same problem where burdens fall on the shoulders of low-level officials, never the higher-ups. Mainali also pointed out that delays in decision-making grow when the leadership appoints individuals lacking expertise or professionalism. Referring to the  fake Bhutanese refugee scam , he points out the incident where the secretary from the education sector was dragged into the scam after being transferred to the home ministry.  He also hints that political leaders tend to seek individuals with little to no decision-making abilities to influence them easily. He adds attempts are made to discourage those who do not align with their vested interest by transferring them multiple times. The employees are discontent with the system. He emphasised that it also leads to the loss of institutional knowledge when employees are transferred arbitrarily. “Instead employees should be encouraged to learn and grow professionally, with such opportunities available in their own positions of offices and an environment to give their honest opinion, without the fear of being penalised or wrongfully accused and dragged into controversies if we want to remove the latency in decision-making among them.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Subas Chandra Nembang: A courageous advocate for consensus in Nepali politics,"During his tenure as the Chairperson of the Constituent Assembly,  Subas Chandra Nembang  frequently emphasised the importance of having a consensus. His reiterated stance that “consensus is necessary and there is no alternative to consensus” at times appeared to some as a sign of the speaker’s cautious approach. However, he always wanted to bring people together and conducted house proceedings with poise and grace. The outcome of the  initial Constituent Assembly election  instilled a sense of ascendance for the Maoists. The traditionally dominant Nepali Congress and UML parties found themselves taking the back seat. This sparked significant apprehension among the entrenched bureaucracy often referred to as the ‘permanent government’. Among this group, adept at taking advantage, both minor and major figures from the Maoist faction had already begun to emerge. The Maoist forces openly projected an attitude of triumph, despite the armed rebellion concluding through an agreement. On numerous occasions, be they of significant or minor importance, it was evident that leaders and members of the Maoist faction were positioning themselves as the foremost power within the nation. This gradual shift in perception underscored a growing sense of diminishing influence in the old guard of the Nepali Congress and UML alliance. The world was watching Nepal during the peace process and how the country would manage the combatants and the weapons. The  United Nations  played a growing role, hosting power centres discreetly. The conduct of Maoist leaders and activists, marked by the lingering scars of war, along with the vigilant monitoring by security agencies, including the army, hinted at an impending event in the country. In hindsight, we can only feel grateful that the country has arrived at this state. Subas Chandra Nembang assumed the role of Chair of the Constituent Assembly during a time of considerable political and social instability. The country was inching towards another form of conflict, driven by the assertiveness of the victorious-minded Maoists and the defeated mindset of the old regime. During this period, international allies were actively involved in aiding the constitution-making process under the guise of assistance. Conducting the Constituent Assembly under such circumstances was an inherently challenging task for Subas Chandra Nembang. From the initial stages leading up to the establishment of the second Constituent Assembly, there were numerous changes in the events. As the Maoists gained prominence and new political parties joined the Constituent Assembly, this shift in dynamics sparked new conflicts. Despite the changing landscape, Subas Chandra Nembang continued to emphasise the same message, persisting in his calls for coordination and cooperation, even in circumstances where they might have appeared unnecessary. Voice of reason This was a time when the country needed to address two crucial issues: defining the core content of the constitution and deciding the fate of the Maoist army. Given the challenges faced in conducting the Constituent Assembly meeting, it was a weighty responsibility to forge consensus on these matters. Looking back, Subas Chandra Nembang shouldered this task with relative ease. Inside the Constituent Assembly, there were intense debates about the justice system and citizenship. They also had to decide on important issues like the type of government, how to divide constituencies, the ratio of population to representatives, the structure of the legislature, and how parties would be represented. These issues were so contentious and polarising that convening a discussion seemed a daunting prospect. Yet, Subas Chandra Nembang took on this formidable task. Topics like pluralism, people’s war, the right to self-determination, the national flag, and the debate between amendable and non-amendable issues were highly contentious. Another crucial aspect of the peace process was the integration and adaptation of the Maoist guerrillas and the democratisation of the Nepali Army, which had the potential to cause significant disruptions in the House. Subas Chandra Nembang adeptly managed these sensitive matters. Believer in dialogue Examining other South Asian countries besides Nepal provides a clear illustration of the significance of coordination and cooperation in politics and within a nation’s political system. The tensions between the government and opposition in India, the adversarial dynamic between parties in Bangladesh, and the divide between the government, opposition and the military in Pakistan all underscore the impact of consensus and cooperation, emphasising Subas Chandra Nembang’s crucial role within Nepal’s political landscape. Subas Chandra Nembang, a distinguished scholar in the field of criminology and an authority on the application of constitutional and legal principles in politics, was characterised by his measured demeanour, avoiding excessive enthusiasm and flashy reactions. His approach often involved nuanced responses to various situations. He emerged as a staunch advocate for consensus and cooperation, assuming the role of their spokesperson. While it is true that many issues remained unresolved, Nepali politics did not descend to the level of intolerance seen in some other South Asian nations. Regardless of the nature of disputes and disagreements, the tradition of leaders coming together for discussions still persists in Nepali politics. Subas Chandra Nembang played an integral role in establishing and preserving this positive political culture. This is what he will be remembered for.",political
"Subas Chandra Nembang, Nepal’s key constitution drafter, is no more","Kathmandu, September 12 Former speaker  and UML leader Subas Chandra Nembang died on September 12. Nembang, a member of the  House of Representatives  died following a heart attack. He was 71 years old. Family members found him collapsed in a toilet and rushed him to the hospital in the early hours of Tuesday morning. However, the doctors pronounced him dead upon arrival. Chairing both the first and second Constituent Assemblies between 2008 and 2015, he oversaw the promulgation of the constitution on September 15, 2015. He played a crucial role in bringing together all parties to ensure the constitution was drafted before the set deadline. Senior leaders including Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and UML chair KP Sharma Oli among others went to TU Teaching Hospital to pay condolences to the Nembang family.  Subas Chandra Nembang’s body will be taken to the UML party office in Chyasal in Lalitpur and will be kept there until September 13. He will be cremated on Wednesday.",political
The Public Life of Women: Important documentation of feminist achievements,"When I got the copy of The Public Life of Women, published by  Nepal Picture Library  as a part of the  Feminist Memory Project,  the first thing I noticed was how portable it is and how it fits so well in handbags carried by women.  As I observed The Public Life of Women’s presentation, I noticed a thoughtful design choice: it featured a combination of black text on a white background and white text on black pages, all with a comfortable reading experience. This design struck me as particularly user-friendly, especially keeping in mind that this book may also be read by rural women. At this juncture of time when people are being carried away by “the end of history” thesis advocated by postmodernism, The Public Life of Women acts as a reminder of the importance of history, ideology, and political movements.  Similarly, in today’s digital world where our eyeballs are glued to screens flooded by neverending streams of digital images, this pictorial history has allowed our eyes to take a pause and to see a part of history in perspective. It has allowed our hands to turn the pages of history and our nervous system to be tickled by the fine rustling of the flipping pages. Women in action We are greeted by pictures of women from all walks of life gathering for an aamsabha (mass gathering) where one can not only see but feel in action, the anticipation in their excited faces. This is followed by photos taken during various  political movements  including anti-Rana pro-democracy movements, Jana Andolan and the People’s War, punctured in between with individual photos depicting Tharu, Arya Khas, Janajati, Dalit, and LGBT women among others. They include urban women from Kathmandu valley as well as village women from several districts across the country. Women can be seen engaged in education, in factories, in poetry, in media, in development work, in international conferences, and in adventurous sports. This is enriched further with handwritten letters, diaries and women’s magazine covers making one so nostalgic! Remarkably, the book offers glimpses of renowned feminists and women leaders in their candid, everyday moments. It includes a photograph of Meena Acharya dancing during her student days in Russia, Sahana Pradhan in a teasing mood with her husband Pushpalal Shrestha, and Shanta Manavi posing as a driver in a dummy car at a photo studio in Benaras. The Public Life of Women showcases images of ordinary women captured in various impactful situations, such as Uma Devi Badi protesting the conditions of the Badi community by displaying her petticoat and bras, schoolgirls enthusiastically participating in a running competition, Madhesi women attending literacy classes, women undertaking development work in remote areas, a Kamlari woman leader addressing the Free Kamaiya Movement in Kailali, and photos of Tharu women from Dang who led a peasants’ revolt in 1980 against local landlords. Included in The Public Life of Women are individual portraits of women from diverse age groups, in different attires, district heads of women’s class organisations, and women with graduation certificates. Seen together, they speak volumes about Nepali women’s history, their professions, and their personalities. Several group portraits are also included that show solidarity. Some women have innocent looks, some display determination, and some carry mischievous smiles on their faces. We can notice their body language, their fashion sense, and hair and makeup trends. We see details like the watches they are wearing, their rings, their bags, and the beautiful patterns on their garments, which all produce a very intimate sense of our past. Photos of Nani Maiya Dahal winning the election in the Panchayat era reminded me that the gutsy spirit of Nani Maiya is alive and kicking even today. The photo of lone CDO Usha Nepal riding a horse made me think of today’s women CDOs driving motorcycles and cars. Similarly, the figure of poet and writer Parijat pricked me that till today a woman of her stature has not been born again. Indeed many photos of her have been showcased in the book. I particularly felt empowered to see Parijat surrounded by an enrapt crowd of men. The elements that stood out in these collections are those portraying women as soldiers in the People’s Liberation Army, but also as newsreaders, leaders, and members of militias meting out justice to wrongdoers. These images, along with accompanying letters and documents from the Maoist People’s War, hold particular significance as they encapsulate the militant facets of women’s contributions to the struggle. Elements of surprises Amongst all the photos, the photos of Rashmi Rajya Laxmi taken in the 1950s and ’60s took me by surprise. Her journey as an assistant director of Radio Nepal, and her marriage to a radical Jagat Prakash Jung Shah who was related to the Royal family is interesting to note. Her seductive photo with her husband tells us how much they were in love. The poem in memory of her late husband before she died by suicide in her bridal dress after her husband was killed in action by the Nepali army for siding with BP Koirala made me even more curious about her life. However, The Public Life of Women seems to have overlooked including photos of women in the field of nursing, which is a predominantly women’s occupation. Similarly, while The Public Life of Women has depicted women with children in public life, the presence of pregnant women in public life is not seen, which could have been a powerful body language. I would have also liked to see photos of Chhaya Devi Parajuli representing women above 70 years boldly leading the People’s Movements in Kathmandu. Several of my friends insisted on flipping through the book again and again looking for themselves, wondering why they or their friends were missing despite them being a part of the movement. The book has truly generated great enthusiasm among us to dig out more of the old photos and documents we have with us. This book also reminded me of the earthquakes in 2015 in which I lost many valuable documents including important old photos that went with the collapse of my five-story building, which killed four inhabitants in my house in Bhurungkhel, Kathmandu. Had the creators of this book thought of this idea before 2015 maybe they would have saved even more valuable unique photos. Lastly, the conversation between curators  Diwas Raja Kc  and  NayanTara Gurung Kakshapati  during the book launch was very engaging. The discussions between them showed that they knew the subject well. The book is indeed very enticing; it made me go back again and again to revisit some of my friends I recognised in aamsabhas and also to see whether similar or even more important events have been covered in the book.  I wholeheartedly thank the Nepal Picture Library team for democratising the process of telling history by not only making it inclusive but also inculcating a sense of ownership and belonging amongst ordinary history makers—those who are included in the book as well as those who will keenly view and read the book. People will cherish this work. They will be eager to see this work grow in perpetuity. At least I am!",political

"SC says Uddab Karki’s appointment unconstitutional, orders Hikmat Karki to be appointed CM of Koshi Province","Kathmandu, September 8 The  Supreme Court  (SC) on Thursday issued a mandamus order to form a council of ministers within 48 hours in the Koshi Province by concluding that the  vote of confidence motion taken by Chief Minister Uddhab Thapa  was unconstitutional. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla, Dr Kumar Chudal and Nahakul Subedi issued the mandamus order in the name of the Koshi Province Chief to form a new government as per Article 168 (3) of the Constitution of Nepal. The SC said that the natural options directed by the constitution should be used accordingly adding that the parliamentary party leader of the single largest party is deemed necessary to be appointed as the Chief Minister. The SC has stated that opting for the alternatives given by the constitution is appropriate in terms of healthy constitutional exercise instead of applying a single option repeatedly.

Govt bringing provision to grant NRNs Nepali citizenship,"Kathmandu, September 6 The government has opened the door to grant NRNs Nepali citizenship.  With the approval of the Citizenship Regulations by the  Council of Ministers , provisions have been established to grant Nepali citizenship to non-resident Nepalis (NRNs), thereby opening up a pathway for NRNs to obtain citizenship. While the revised Citizenship Act received  approval from President Ram Chandra Paudel in May , the corresponding regulations had not been established until recently. Sources told Onlinekhabar that the Cabinet meeting held on August 29 has now passed these regulations. However, the government has not officially released information regarding this development, resulting in a lack of detailed information regarding its specific provisions. Sources close to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was active and determined to pass the regulations. “Before his  visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly , the Prime Minister wants to convey a message to the NRNs present there that they would be allowed to have Nepali citizenship too,” said the source. “Consequently, there was a particular emphasis placed on the enactment of the citizenship regulations.” With the new provision, NRNs will find it easier to invest in Nepal along with owning properties. They can also engage in other social and cultural activities. The citizenship, however, will not allow the NRNs any political rights. This means those who have both international and Nepali citizenship will not be allowed to vote, contest an election or hold government posts.",political

Voices of change: The right to protest and its significance in democratic societies,"In any thriving  democracy , the right to protest stands as a cornerstone, a testament to the power of collective voice and the value placed on citizens’ participation in shaping the course of their nation. This fundamental right, enshrined in numerous international treaties and constitutions, serves as a vital mechanism for citizens to express dissent, demand accountability, and advocate for change. As societies evolve,  the right to protest  remains a powerful tool that ensures governments remain responsive to the needs and aspirations of their people. In the annals of history, there exists a chorus of voices, a harmonious symphony of conviction and courage, echoing through time. These are the voices of those who dared to challenge the status quo, who stood undeterred in the face of adversity, and who championed the cause of change through the power of protest. At the heart of this symphony lies the fundamental right to protest – a right that transcends legal statutes and transforms into a powerful embodiment of democratic essence.  Protest as a universal language In a world marked by its diversity of cultures, opinions, and aspirations, the right to protest emerges as a universal language spoken by the people and understood by governments. It is a language that communicates not only dissent but also the fervent desire for progress. One of the most prominent episodes in Nepal’s history is the  People’s Movement of 1990 , also known as the Jana Andolan. Fueled by a desire for democracy and freedom from the authoritarian rule of the monarchy, Nepali citizens from all walks of life united in a massive protest movement. The culmination of this movement led to the restoration of democracy, the establishment of a multiparty system, and the drafting of a new constitution that enshrined fundamental rights, including the right to protest. In the years that followed, the people of Nepal continued to  exercise their right to protest  to demand accountability, inclusion, and social justice. The  Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2006 , which ended the decade-long civil conflict between the government and Maoist rebels, was a testament to the power of collective action. Citizens nationwide rallied for peace and change, contributing to establishing a more inclusive political framework. Furthermore, Nepal’s transition from a monarchy to a federal democratic republic in 2008 was marked by widespread protests advocating for the representation and recognition of marginalised communities, including indigenous groups, women, and Dalits. These protests were instrumental in shaping the constitutional provisions that recognise and protect the rights of these historically marginalised sections of society.  In recent times, Nepal has grappled with the need to strike a balance between preserving the right to protest and maintaining social order. Balancing the exercise of this right The  Constitution of Nepal  guarantees the right to peaceful assembly and demonstration, but the interpretation and implementation of these rights have sometimes led to tensions between protesters and authorities. Balancing the exercise of this right with the responsibilities of maintaining public safety and preventing disruption remains an ongoing challenge. At its core, democracy thrives on the principle of representation and participation. A government “for the people” necessitates not only the ability of citizens to elect their representatives but also their capacity to engage actively in shaping the policies and decisions that impact their lives. In this intricate dance between governance and citizenship, the right to protest emerges as a profound manifestation of the democratic spirit, enabling citizens to engage directly with the decision-making process. In a democracy, the relationship between the governed and the government is symbiotic, interdependent, and fluid. Citizens grant authority to their elected representatives to make decisions on their behalf, trusting that these decisions will align with the collective well-being. However, the very essence of democracy acknowledges that power, when unchecked, can lead to overreach and neglect of certain segments of the population. The right to protest, in this context, is not merely an isolated act but an intrinsic part of the democratic fabric. It reinforces the understanding that the government exists to serve the people and not vice versa. By expressing concerns, grievances, and opinions openly through protests, citizens contribute to the formulation of policies that reflect the diverse needs and aspirations of the populace. Tool for fostering accountability Moreover, the right to protest is a powerful tool for fostering accountability. In a democracy, where transparency and responsiveness are fundamental tenets, protests serve as a reminder that elected officials and public institutions are answerable to the people. This accountability is not only limited to the immediate demands of a specific protest but also extends to the broader ideals of good governance, ethical conduct, and adherence to the rule of law.  As societies evolve and technology redefines the parameters of communication, the right to protest has extended its reach into the digital realm. Social media platforms, for instance, have become virtual town squares where individuals can amplify their voices, share their concerns, and mobilise support for various causes. While this digital shift has expanded the scope of protest, it also raises questions about the authenticity of engagement and the impact of online activism on real-world change. In a world where information flows more freely than ever before, the right to protest remains a cornerstone of democracy. While the right to protest is fundamental, its exercise is not without boundaries. Just as the right itself is a reflection of democratic values, the responsible exercise of this right mirrors the maturity and civility of a society. In the realm of protests, responsibility emerges as a guiding principle that harmonises the pursuit of change with the preservation of order, respect for individual rights, and the protection of the common good. The distinction between legitimate protest and unruly disruption lies in the approach taken by those participating. Respecting the rule of law is paramount; protests that descend into violence and destruction not only undermine the sanctity of the cause but also erode the trust and sympathy of the public. Such instances obscure the core message, overshadowing the grievances with images of chaos and lawlessness. In these moments, what began as a noble expression of dissent loses its moral high ground and detracts from the actual issues at hand.  It is the responsibility of both protesters and authorities to uphold the integrity of the protest space. Protesters must be cognizant of the fact that their actions reflect not only their cause but also their commitment to democratic values. A responsible protester acknowledges that peaceful demonstrations, when conducted with dignity and respect, possess a potency that resonates far more deeply than any act of aggression. This understanding paves the way for a productive dialogue, as it reinforces the sincerity of the protesters’ convictions.  Equally, responsible protest management on the part of authorities is pivotal for maintaining a delicate balance. In the digital age, responsible protest also extends to the realm of social media. Online activism, while powerful in its reach, demands ethical responsibility. Spreading misinformation or resorting to online harassment undermines the credibility of the cause and fractures the unity that is the hallmark of effective protest movements. In essence, the responsible exercise of the right to protest acknowledges that democracy thrives not on chaos but on respectful dialogue and engagement. In conclusion, the right to protest is not just a component of democracy; it is its lifeblood. The right to protest, far from being a mere option, is the heartbeat of democracy, a fundamental right that resonates with the core of our collective aspirations for a just, equitable, and vibrant society.",political
Maoist Centre urges diplomatic dialogue over China’s recently issued map,"Kathmandu, September 1 The  CPN-Maoist Centre  has shown concern saying that  the map issued by China  on Monday, which does not include  Nepal’s updated political map , should be discussed through diplomatic channels.

Govt agencies banned from developing software without due research,"Kathmandu, August 29 The government has banned unnecessary development of software in government agencies.

"Karnali Province emerged from the bedrock of a movement, yet the pursuit of prosperity remains a far cry","In the late hours of August 7, 2015, key political leaders came to a significant agreement regarding the  country’s federal structure  along with the demarcation of six provinces. The next day on August 8 the rallying cry for a united Midwest was raised in Birendranagar, the headquarters of the then Midwestern Development Zone. People were furious and irked as major areas of Karnalai were included in Sudurpacschim Province during the demarcation. Despite senior leaders asking people not to protest, they did not listen. They wanted their own identity and under the banner of the United Midwest, they forced the state to set up seven provinces, instead of the previously decided six. That is how  Karnali Province  was born. Initiation of a movement  The movement was initially led by Tej Bikram Basnet, associate professor at  Mid-West University .  According to Basnet, the initial demarcation would be unfair to the people of Bheri, Rapti and Karnali as they would have been governed from the Sudurpaschim Province and the capital of the province would also be in the far west region of Nepal. That, Basnet says, would create a hassle for those living in Karnali. That is why the people of the region called for the establishment of Karnali Province. “It did not make sense. Federalism was meant to make things easy but here the state was trying to make our lives difficult,” says Banset. The movement started at the closed doors of Mid-West University. However, soon it spread out to all the districts, headquarters and villages in the Karnali region. The spread was so unprecedented, that things got out of control on the second day. Protestors vandalised the District Administration Office of Surkhet and the Jhupra Comprehensive Water Project. Agitated, they also burned the party office of UML, Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre along with attacks on the homes of political leaders.  The violence of separation  Although the movement began under the leadership of Basnet, no one really took ownership of it. With no institution leading it, the movement got out of control and violent. On August 10, Yam Bahadur BC, Tika Ram Gautam and Gopal Singh Rajwar of Surkhet were  shot dead by the police . Basnet, frustrated, stepped down after the movement became violent. The violence, however, did not stop. On the same day a joint meeting of Basnet and civil society formed a struggle committee of 151 members under the coordination of Padma Bahadur Shahi, the then-regional president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, says Basnet. With political parties coy on whether to be involved or not, cadres of political parties did not get involved in the movement.  “They did not have the support of the centre. However, with pressure mounting, they had to be part of it,” says Basnet. As the movement was pushing on, local  Hari Bahadur Kunwar  lost his life in Jumla. The tussle between the locals of Karnli and the state lasted for 13 days. Soon the central government caved in and decided to establish Province 6 (Karnali Province) on August 21, 2015. The movement wanted the then-Midwestern Development Region to be named Karnali Provice as it had mountains, hills and plains. However, the leaders were not ready to do so. The idea behind that was the people wanted Karnali Province to be connected to both India and China. “We wanted to use everything in our power to become an economically strong province,” says Basnet. Pitambar Dhakal, the former dean of Mid-West University, recollects the movement as a point in time when the public compelled the leaders to take to the streets. “Public emerged victorious on August 21, 2015,” says Dhakal. “There is a difference between the formation of Karnali Province and other provinces. Karnali Province was formed due to the movement.” After the promulgation of the constitution, the province was known as Province 6, however, the meeting of the provincial assembly on February 24, 2018, renamed it Karnali Province. Karnali Day and its identity The Karnali government celebrates August 21 as the province’s established day. A public holiday is observed on that day. Even though the struggle gave a separate province to the locals of Karnali, when it comes to development, it still lags behind. Another major motive of the movement was the development of the Karnali region. The public, however, is disappointed as they are detached from the development.  The stakeholder complains that the Karnali Province’s government has failed to fulfil the dreams of martyrs. The government acknowledged all four individuals who lost their lives on August 18, 2015, as martyrs. However, the martyrs’ families complain that the government has forgotten those martyrs.  Raj Bahadur Kunwar of Jumla, who lost his brother in the movement is frustrated. He feels his brother died for a lost cause.  “Their dreams are being covered by black clouds,” he says. Bhagwati BC, sister of martyr Yam Bahadur BC also echoes Kunwar. She says the government has failed to appreciate the contributions of martyrs.  “The provincial government broke their promises and this has left us sad and disappointed,” she says. “They pledged to construct statues of martyrs, establish a martyr’s park and provide employment to the martyr’s family, among others. But they have done none of these things.”  The objective of the movement was not only about gaining a separate province. It was also for the development of Karnali and to enhance the lifestyle of the people of Karnali, says Basnet. “Apart from a handful of people, this has not benefited anyone else,” says Basnet. “If only the government had utilised the natural resources of Karnali Province, the province would have witnessed economic growth on another scale.” Basnet and others like him believe that the progress of Karnali Province is limited to having had three chief ministers and some of its parliamentarians serving as ministers. “We have not started any important projects, nor has the provincial government built a road to Rara,” says Basnet. Basnet says rather than prioritising advancements, leadership remains fixated on personal gains. Dinesh Gautam, a federalism researcher, highlights that while federalism has yielded certain benefits, it has not been accompanied by suitable legislation and competent individuals. He believes while federalism has given provinces like Karnali Province a lot, it still has not been able to give proper laws and people who can implement these laws. “It is clear what is lacking is competent leadership,” says Gautam. “Although the province was the result of a movement, the province is being governed by some limited people, which is creating problems.” He attributes this to the conservative nature of the leaders and emphasises the need for a more progressive form of leadership. Federalism designated Surkhet as the capital of Karnali Province, providing it with substantial budgets and resources. As a result, the residents of Humla no longer have to travel to Kathmandu to demand development plans and resources. “It gave Karnali an identity but a lot more needs to be done for the province to fulfil the potential people saw eight years ago,” says Gautam.

Supreme Court raises questions over President’s pardon of Resham Chaudhary,"Kathmandu, August 17 The  Supreme Court  has raised serious questions regarding  President Ramchandra Paudel’s decision  to  grant a pardon for the life imprisonment of Resham Chaudhary , the leader of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. The Supreme Court has published the complete text of the case concerning the  Tikapur incident  and described it as a ‘cruel, inhumane, and unimaginable event within a civilised society’. The Supreme Court has stated that the mob led by Resham Chaudhary assaulted eight police officers using sticks, stones, and axes. They inserted spears into their eyes and doused their bodies with petrol and kerosene.  “The act of murder carried out in an extraordinarily brutal, heartless, and ruthless manner is clear to see,” it said in its definition of the incident. Ramesh Badal, a former Attorney General and Senior Advocate, believes that this statement from the Supreme Court implies that the pardon granted to Resham Chaudhary should be nullified. “It was wrong for the president to pardon him without the full text of the verdict being released,” Badal told Onlinekhabar. “Our law does not allow for people who have been involved in such inhumane crime to be pardoned.” Article 276 of the  Constitution of Nepal  includes a provision for pardon, stipulating that “The President possesses the authority to grant pardons, reprieves, alterations, or reductions to sentences issued by any court, judicial or quasi-judicial entity, or administrative officer or entity, as per the provisions of the law.” The constitution specifically addresses the matters of pardon and reprieve exclusively in accordance with the law. In this regard, Section 159 of the Civil Code of Criminal Procedure Act, 2017 outlines the possibility of sentence waiver.  As per this provision, an individual who has been sentenced based on a court judgment can submit an application through the Ministry of Home Affairs to the President, seeking a pardon or reduction of the sentence. The act has a stipulation requiring the individual seeking pardon to include a copy of the court verdict. However, in Chaudhary’s case, the president pardoned him without the final verdict being released.",political
Beyond the numbers: Reservation remains a cornerstone state policy,"Nepal as a policy in 2007 The citizens of a civilised society will get a sense of justice when they are entitled to equal opportunity in all the  organs of the state.  For every state to accelerate its development, it should ensure equal participation of all the citizens in all state organs irrespective of their gender, caste, ethnicity/race, language, religion, and geo/political status.  For any underdeveloped or developing state where there is no equal participation of all the citizens in all organs of government, reservations for backward and marginalised communities can be used as a tool to ensure equal participation. To achieve the intended goals, reservation policies must be part of a comprehensive strategy that addresses broader inequalities and undergoes periodic evaluation and refinement. So does reservation work?  Reservation as a tool of social inclusion  Reservation is one of the tools of social inclusion which was adopted by  Nepal as a policy in 2007 . If we dig down the history of the practice of reservation, the then prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa planned to reserve 35 per cent of civil service posts: women would constitute 20 per cent, Dalits 10 per cent, and Janajati (indigenous) 5 per cent and have also formed a committee to implement the reform, but due to political and governmental instability, it was not executed.  After a series of attempts by many governments, the reservation policy was introduced in the interim constitution, which for promulgated after the  People’s Movement of 2006 . Additionally to this, the second amendment of the Civil Service Act, of 2007 introduced 45 per cent reservations for disadvantaged groups. The constitution of Nepal 2015 has ensured the equal participation of all marginalised people in state organs.   Article 42 of the constitution states : “The socially backward women, Dalit, indigenous people, indigenous nationalities, Madhesi, Tharu, minorities, persons with disabilities, marginalised communities, Muslims, backward classes, gender and sexual minorities, youths, farmers, labourers, oppressed or citizens of backward regions and indigent Khas Arya shall have the right to participate in the state bodies on the basis of inclusive principle.”  However, the practice seems to reveal something different.  Time for need and ethnicity-based system  The concept of reservation which was introduced with an aim to ensure the involvement of marginalised communities has not been enforced in the same manner, also evidenced by various facts and figures. First, reservation undermines the concept of equality among all people on the lines of gender and ethnicity/caste, and therefore might not be aligned with Nepal’s constitutional right to equality for all. On the other hand, the reserved seats and services for backward communities have been “occupied” by the creamy layer of each of the cluster groups. As of the data of the  Economic Survey 2020/2021 , a total of 53,470 people have entered various government services in the last 10 years. Out of these 59.49 per cent of people have been selected from the open competition and 40.5 per cent have been selected by using the facilities of reservation.  However, if you deeply look into society, the reserved seat for backward people is mainly occupied by the same community’s creamy layer. The result is not as shown in the numbers by the different surveys of government reports. The judiciary has also been working to make optimum use of reservation policy for the inclusion of all the people of backward communities. For instance, the Supreme Court rendered a decision stating that in a sensitive sector like health, where every citizen needs to rely on their health, the system should be handled by competent human resources, providing opportunities to incompetent in the name of social inclusion will degrade the health service of the country.  It further explains that, a person who is provided with a reserved seat in the bachelor’s level. To award the reservation seat of postgraduate to the same person will be against the principle of equality, which will further dent the gap between the citizen of the society. They achieve the optimum benefit from the reservation policy for social inclusion. The system shall be based on “need” rather than “ethnicity”. If the reservation policy has been based on the need then the real needy person of the community will get the benefit.",political

Unfulfilled promises: Assessing women’s participation in local governance in Nepal,"House of Representatives election act, 2017, section 60(4) has ensured  33 per cent of seats for women  in the parliament and all other highest positions such as president and vice president, speaker and deputy speaker of Parliament (in both upper and lower houses), mayor and Deputy Mayor where one of two must be female has been provisioned.  Further, it has ensured inclusive provisions and other provisions have increased women’s participation comparatively at the local level as well. With all these provisions in Nepal’s constitution, the status of women’s representation at the local level is still unsatisfactory due to the loopholes of the law, which have hampered their representation. Landmark for Nepal: 2017 Elections  In 2017, Nepal marked a significant milestone by conducting its first elections after the adoption of the new constitution in 2015. This event was notable as it was the first time in more than 17 years that the country held elections at the local level under the federal republican political system.  It was also a successful year in terms of women’s political empowerment and social inclusion as it saw representation from women and marginalised voters and candidates. The first local-level election after Republican Nepal was held in three phases. There were a total of 148,364 candidates and among them only 57,843 were female.  Election Result book, 2074 (Page 31)  published by Election Commission shows that 3,541 representatives were elected with which the number of female elected representatives was 14,352. It is 40.95 per cent. Out of 6,743 wards, 173 wards had no candidates of Dalit female candidates and women’s representation was hampered due to null candidacy. Local level election 2022 The second local-level election under the federal structure took place on May 13, 2022. According to the Election Commission, the number of adult voters was 17,733,723. Out of which, 8,741,530 were women. This is 49.29 per cent of the total voters.  Election result book, 2022 (Page18)  shows that from the local level election 2022, 35,221 representatives were to be elected directly. Among them, 14,239 seats are mandatory and secured for female representatives. However, the number of total elected female representatives in the local-level election in 2022 is 14,466. In this election, 123 wards out of 6,743 total wards had no candidate from Dalit female member and one ward was null in female member candidacy. Comparative analysis of two local elections The data analysed is from the latest election result book of the Election Commission. As per this, 41.21 per cent of women are among the total elected in 2022 compared to 40.9 per cent in 2017. In the first federal local level election 14,402 women got elected in 2022 compared to 14,352 in 2017.  Based on the statistics, it is evident that there was a  decline in the number of women contestants  in the 2022 local elections compared to the 2017 elections. However, despite this downward trend, the final number of women who were successfully elected in the 2022 elections appears to be slightly higher than that of the 2017 elections. This clearly indicates the higher winnability displayed by the women candidates in the 2022 local elections. However, it has been found in practice that women are made candidates due to the compulsion of law and not for meaningful representation.  For example, among two major posts at the local level, one is mandatory for female candidates where parties are compelled to contest female candidates but not by interest. The same thing is found in two female members of the ward committee.  As a result, most of the heads of local-level and ward committees are male. In the last local level election, out of heads of 753 local level, only  25 females got elected as head of the local level.  This number was 18 in 2017. It shows that the leading position is just made for males. The legislative intent for women’s representation is not just for the minimum but at least 50 per cent and in major posts as well. But the  15  Annual Report (2022)  of the National Women Commission shows a very low representation of women in major posts from the last elections at the local level. Call for change The constitution of Nepal has highly emphasised ensuring gender justice almost in every sphere in comparison to previous constitutions. The local-level election is conducted on the basis of the Local-level Election Act, 2016. This act has ensured at least 50 per cent of women’s representation in major two posts at the local level and 40 per cent as a whole. Section 17(4) of the act states that while nominating either for head or deputy head of the local level, the political parties should arrange in such a way that at least a candidate for any one of two head positions should be women.  At the same time, the further elaboration of the provision states that if the political parties contest for only one post of the head or deputy head of the local level, the above-mentioned provision will not be compulsory. Here we see the loopholes in the law. The same is found in the nomination of ward members as well which hampers women’s representation. The spirit of the law is to increase the meaningful representation of women but the play of parties in loops of law has hampered it. For that it should be provisioned that even an alliance of parties should not affect their representation, the reserved seat for females can be one of the solutions as well. So that in major positions, the political parties only contest female candidates and obviously one of the females will win.",political

The practice of non-party flag bearer at the local level,"The  Constitution of Nepal 2015,  defines the role of local government widely known as local level. The local level plays a crucial role in governing, service delivery, planning and development and managing the overall affairs of the local government. Despite having all the authority, it seems that the chief representatives of the local government failed to deliver their duties as per citizens’ concerns. The reason is working under the pressure of their own party pressure along with the leader’s and followers’ interest, as a result, the service delivery is not seen as satisfactory. Nepal’s constitution has given the right to local government to make 22 laws and 15 common rights as needed. To illustrate further, to work under their own area; the constitution has given administrative, executive and some judicial rights. But chief representatives are not able to make and implement this type of law, it can be assumed that they are helpless due to their party’s interest.  However, an independent candidate is seen as more free and flexible as they do not have the blessing hands of any political party. As a result, they can perform work freely without any political pressure.  Kathmandu’s Mayor Balendra Shah  and  Dharan’s Mayor Harka Sampang Rai  are living examples.  Need to strengthen the pillar of democracy It is said that the local level or local government is the pillar of democracy, and the overall development of the nation depends on local government activities. In particular, the local government has the power to take decisions that suit local needs and conditions, and it has the right to plan and coordinate service delivery in its area.  To institutionalise and strengthen democracy, the greatest potential is seen at the local level. If representatives are directly concerned with the citizen’s issues and are accountable, improvements can be made at the time of service delivery and governance.  However, due to political fluctuation, it has not been done accordingly. In the current scenario, people are more fascinated towards independent representatives. Examining the people’s psychology, an independent representative can work freely in metropolitan cities, sub-metropolitan cities, and rural municipalities as well as ward levels.  If we can practice a non-party flag bearer representative at the local levels, the overall development will gear up and there will be no party interruption. As a consequence, the development will be sustainable and the representatives can do their duties freely.  Comparatively independent candidates can engage more with communities to seek their input and involve them at the time of decision-making. This has been seen through Kathmandu metropolitan city’s Mayor who takes decisions on any matter quickly and productively.  Whether it comes to not picking up the waste materials from the Sighadurbar to destroying the illegal construction of high-profile people. He is able to do them because he does relate to any party and does not have to work under follower interest, party pressure and many more. Likewise, if a flag bearer candidate was elected they need to think and need the party’s approval before executing any of their plans. Similarly, Dharan sub-metropolitan city’s Mayor is also  popular for his work  and has great support from the people. His remarkable work is bringing drinking water with public support. There are a lot of examples which show that an independent candidate can work freely with public sympathy in any matter. The way ahead Political history shows that local level representative related to political parties could not meet their manifesto, which they distributed during the election period for public assurance. Comparatively, it seems that independent candidates work as per the public’s sentiment. In the democratic countries of the world such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada and even in India, there is a practice of choosing independent candidates at the local levels.  As a result, they get sustainable development and citizens’ rights that are well preserved.  The local government has given more results and the real definition of democracy is well utilised. This may be one of the major factors these nations have gone through drastic development in a short period of time. If Nepal can implement this practice, it will be far better than the ongoing system, as there will be no political deadlock. Then there will be equal budget allocation. Moreover, there will be no influence of sister organisations, which ultimately leads to the development process, and till now the vote of the general public is more decisive than the party practice.  So keeping all these things in mind, if political parties would not nominate their candidates in the local elections then general people can elect their leaders freely without the party’s concern.",political

The downtrend of Nepal’s parliament and its impact on democracy,"Nepal has three main divisions of power— the legislature, the executive and the judiciary— each of them has different functions, duties and responsibilities. Although it seems that the main centralisation of the political system is the executive body (Council of Ministers), Nepal’s  parliament  or legislature is the soul of the state.  According to the principle of checks and balances, the state system is sustainable and people-oriented only if all three parts of the state can function effectively. The best interests of the country and its people can only be achieved by the smooth functioning of the state powers.   The parliamentary system is the most widely accepted in the world so far. It emphasises the balance of power with the distribution of state authority, which can also broadly include the power of the parliament to impeach the authority of the executive post.  In the modern world, the parliamentary system features direct election and selection of members of parliament. It includes a directly elected House of Representatives (HoR) as the lower house and an upper house with  proportional , inclusive, and eminent citizens chosen through various means. The parliament serves as a platform for lawmakers and facilitates the practice of the legal process and guides future actions. However in the present context, Nepal’s parliament has become weak due to the Prime Minister’s desire to hold onto power, the minister’s indifference to the suffering of the people, the fragile performance of the opposition and the lethargy of the parliamentarians. This questions the future of democracy in Nepal.  Dismal status of federal parliament  Nepal’s parliamentarians have failed to raise people’s voices and questions. They are hopeless. They are struggling to get adequate time to speak in the parliament, and whenever they get a chance they speak without proper study and homework.  Those who criticise the government with good arguments and raise people’s concerns and voices are ignored. The positive voice disappears like water bubbles. The creativity of parliamentarians has been killed and cold water is poured on the enthusiastic young parliamentarians who aim to do something for the people.  The dream of the youth has been chiselled, civil rights are being curtailed. Nepal’s lawmakers are found to give priority to the self-interest of the party rather than serving their community. It is not clear whether they are working for the rights of the class, gender, region, or community that they stand for.  Why are they not able to fulfil their influential role? Minimising the roles of the parliament seizes people’s rights and prosperity. Nepal’s parliamentarians should be like the oak trees, which stand even when the wind blows from the opposite direction. Harassing lawmakers means the loss of rights of people in the foggy and smoggy ground.  The belief that politics is the best policy among all policies that guide in making policies in all areas including education, health, finance, foreign affairs, diplomacy, transportation, communication, technology, etc. has now become a pathetic statement as the state of people’s hope and trust is in deficit.  Parliamentary system for consensus  As the parliamentary system is a political system based on consensus, understanding, tolerance and moderation, what is the recognition of the opposition in the parliamentary system?  If the opposition bench remains empty, all businesses get postponed and motions of the parliament are not discussed on that day. If the opposition is bypassed, the system will be authoritarian. The position of the opposition leader in the parliamentary system is the same as that of the waiting prime minister. The access of opposition leaders to every constitutional decision of the government is ensured because they can prevent the government from doing unparliamentary activities by warning them. In Nepal, the institutional devaluation of the opposition, which holds an important place in the development of democracy, is constantly increasing.   Even in the three-decade-long Panchayat system, a partyless system without opposition, there was limited freedom to criticise the government on policy matters that were within the scope of the constitution.  Since 1990, the existence of the opposition has been recognised politically, institutionally and constitutionally. Despite occasional deviations, the opposition has tried to hold the government accountable for issues such as policy distortions, corruption and abuse of power within the state machinery.  The main question is why the creativity of the people’s representatives is not recognised when considering, discussing, and taking action on issues concerning the rights of the common people and the implementation of the constitution. Parliament is a place for the people’s representatives. It is Nepal’s apex body. But when will the situation change, and Nepal’s parliamentarians will no longer be rendered helpless and their roles be acknowledged as valuable rather than worthless? If the government disregards the voice of the parliament, the government is considered to be disrespectful towards parliamentary tradition, practice and dignity. These activities will weaken democracy.  Communists believe that parliament is a shop that sells dog meat by showing the head of a he-goat. Are Nepal’s parliamentarians trying to prove this statement true? The prime minister, ministers and leaders of the government are confirming that the parliament and the parliamentary system should make the people omnipotent, but the people are being treated like animals.  Due to the lack of common understanding among the parties, there is a continuation of collusion with external powers and handing over the country’s natural resources to foreigners. But it can be assumed that the country is moving towards regression due to the state of affairs of the parliament, which is becoming irrelevant. In Singha Durbar and Baluwatar, there is a contradiction between what they say and what they do.  Strengthen the parliament: Trustworthy panacea  The parliament is supposed to make the people confident about the rule of law, but parliamentary practices these days in Nepal are being done selfishly to hold the parliament, hostage. Parliament is becoming a victim of neglect. The parliamentary system is in shambles.  Sadly, the belief in the principle that the state serves its people is dying. Now populist politics is dominant. The awakening of stable politics with trust is the current national need and fundamental public expectation. But why are people’s representatives who earn from people’s taxes unable to speak according to people’s expectations? This is a matter of grave concern of general interest. Most of the lawmakers in Nepal speak in short bursts. They speak merely for formality.  Parliamentarians speak only for the benefit of their political party and overlook the issue that holds national interest. There are only a few lawmakers who come with the necessary homework and put their case in parliament effectively. However, those lawmakers are not appreciated except by the parliamentarians of their party.  Another problem with our parliament is the parliamentarian does not get adequate time to speak. This problem must be solved through certain procedures. While there are also parliamentarians who speak just for formality.  The performance of parliamentarians is doubtful. It seems like they are defaming the parliament in a planned way or deliberately switching off the spirit of the parliament.  The parliament is supposed to make the people confident about the rule of law. But in Nepal, some selfish parliamentary practices are undermining this trust by holding the parliament hostage.  Parliament is becoming a victim of neglect. The parliamentary system is in shambles. The sad aspect is that people have lost their belief in the dignity and power of the state. They do not expect to be helped by the state. At present, populist politics is dominant. It is not easy for parties to fulfil constitutional responsibility and moral obligations in cheap politics and cheap style. To maintain its dignity, it is necessary to make the parliament a centre of people’s faith. If there will be a reliable government, responsible opposition and creative parliamentarians, trust in the parliament will be awakened. As a result, it will contribute to the development of Nepali democracy.",political

Supreme Court annuls appointment of Uddab Thapa as Koshi province chief minister,"Kathmandu, July 27 The  Supreme Court  has annulled the appointment of Uddab Thapa as the chief minister of  Koshi province. The divisional bench of Justices Ishwar Prasad Khatiwada, Anand Mohan Bhattarai and Til Prasad Shrestha annulled Thapa’s appointment. On July 6, Nepali Congress leader Thapa claimed the post of chief minister and submitted a letter to the state chief Parshuram Khapung stating he had the support of Speaker Baburam Gautam. Relying on this support, the state chief,  Khapung, appointed Thapa as the chief minister . Following Thapa’s appointment, outgoing chief minister UML leader Hikmat Kumar Karki filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court. The petition argued that forming a government with the support of the Speaker, who holds a neutral role, is illegal. Karki has claimed he should be reinstated as the chief minister of Koshi province as per Article 168 (3) of the Constitution which states that the leader of the largest party in the provincial assembly should be appointed as the Chief Minister. The Supreme Court in its verdict has said that the Speaker did not have the authority to support any candidate during government formation. Gautam, in doing so, had gone against the constitution of the country. The Supreme Court has declined to re-elect Karki as the Chief Minister, rejecting his claim and refusing to grant him the mandate to appoint the Chief Minister according to his wishes. Karki was  removed from his position as chief ministe r after failing to secure the vote of confidence from the Provincial Assembly in a ballot conducted in Biratnagar on June 30.",political

Beyond socialism: Nepal needs to rethink its political and economic ideals,"Nepal’s political landscape is characterised by the prevalence of socialism, serving as both a dominant ideology and economic system. The country’s Constitution explicitly designates Nepal as a state with a socialist orientation. Similarly, socialism and its ideals have become a focal point for different political parties in Nepal —conventional, new, centre, left, fractured, regional, ethnicity-based, and conservative — to come together and form a political alliance to serve each other’s self-interests. It has become an umbrella term to unite all. Likewise, many people in Nepal still dream that someday the  socialism of BP Koirala  or  Karl Marx  can solve various socio-political or economic problems lingering in our society. Furthermore, most of the people in Nepal anticipate the government to effectively achieve its socialist ideals like comprehensive social welfare, government freebies, distribution of wealth, unconditional basic income, efficient nationalised industries, giving priority to equality, quotas, and reservation systems, direct state intervention in different sectors of the economy, government control of interest rates, wages, and pricing, and imposing high taxes on rich individuals and corporations. However, in a society obsessed with private property, wealth inheritance, family business, nepotism, favouritism, and social hierarchy, the popularity of a socialist ethos appears self-contradictory, paradoxical, and even phoney. After all, when it comes to giving up private properties for public ownership, paying taxes on income and wealth, and collective cooperation, Nepalis do feel reluctant. It’s all about the government The government has to take ownership and responsibility for everything in the socialist model of governance. It lines up from running universities, sports facilities, employment opportunities, education, and healthcare. Nepal’s socialist-oriented political parties running the government have been smart enough to keep Nepali people satisfied with token social welfare programmes and promises of freebies that are neither comprehensive nor sustainable.  And, to exert its control over people and their private enterprises, the government, both federal and local, also comes up with restrictions that undermine individual choice, agency, and freedom of expression.  Besides, to solve the socio-economic problems, the government has invested in, formulated, and established many bogus, non-competitive, and irrelevant institutions, programmes, and public enterprises that have only served the interests of political parties and their associates. Hence, so many public-owned enterprises and institutions are simply a burden on taxpayers.  In a society where everyone looks up to the government, everything becomes dependent on and limited by those who are running the government or close to the politicians of the ruling parties. Unfortunately, this has resulted in unholy collusion and collaboration.  Collaboration between the business class, contractors, and politicians in which a few established business people, members of political parties, student unions, powerful syndicates and unions, and some bureaucrats close to politicians are able to mobilise and manipulate state mechanisms for their own interests.  Hence, Nepal has not been able to maximise the benefits of free enterprise. A free enterprise such as a free market and private enterprises. Then millions of Nepali people are ironically forced to seek employment opportunities in countries where there is limited government, economic freedom, free enterprises, freedom of expression, business-friendly policies, and an industrialised market economy. Rigid socialist state mechanism as a burden for individual ventures Socialist criticism of society makes the false assumption that business persons and private enterprises achieve material gains, successes, and profit maximisation due to exploitation of the masses, manipulation of the system, and corruption.  Whereas in reality, many people from poor economic backgrounds have become rich and successful due to their hard work, commitment, risk-taking, entrepreneurship, business initiation, and effective decision-making without exploiting the masses or manipulating the system.  However, based on socialist analysis, most people in Nepal believe that people with money control everything and are also corrupt. As a result, society runs on needless hatred of the business class and industrialists. Moreover, the problem with the socialist governance model is that it gives priority to government systems, policies, collectivist ideals, and state mechanisms over individual decisions, choices, or private initiations and actions.  Whereas, due to the sociocultural influence of globalisation, people in Nepal are also becoming more individualistic, and their mindset is driven by personal interests, freedom, and independence. As a result, individuals and private business ventures with brilliant business ideas feel burdened by the rigid regulations of the government in Nepal. Moreover, they become reluctant to initiate business and industrial ventures in Nepal. This rigidity also undermines foreign direct investment. There are alternatives Almost everyone wants to live in a society that is classless and provides equal outcomes to all, together with comprehensive social welfare and collective ownership; however, political aspirations and events that have been undertaken to fulfil these dreams have only resulted in division, destruction, deaths, exploitation, and misery for millions of people in Nepal. Take the examples of China and India, both of which, after moving beyond the ideals of Maoism and Nehruvian socialism and adjusting and adopting economic liberalisation, business-friendly policies, and a free market economy, have become the second and fifth-largest economies in the world, respectively. Surely, in Nepal, we can also rethink, explore, and consider other political and economic ideals apart from socialism to overcome our socioeconomic problems.",political
Transformative peace: A prerequisite for sustainable peace,"UN Women Arab States Nepal is almost in the 17th year of its  peace process . The citizens who were affected by the conflict during 1996-2006, especially the  women who faced conflict-related sexual violence , still are experiencing structural and cultural violence in their daily lives.  In addition, they have been continuously feeling injustice, and mistrust and dealing with a great deal of  grief, and trauma  that has been brewing for decades. The genuine demands, needs, and suffering of these women, which have always been exploited for political interests, have led to their silencing and exclusion during this post-conflict period Patriarchy influenced justice  The national government which is mostly headed by men, has intentionally ignored this agenda in their regular dialogue process. It is because the suffering of women never resonated in their hearts as their mothers, sisters or daughters did not have to experience this heinous crime and suffering.  And equally, the three-tier government structures also failed to prepare the communities for the ongoing dialogues to address the legacy of the armed conflict.  The suffering of women is still deepening the existing scars and polarising the communities with the new sense of division perpetuated by the so-called political parties. In this context, the longstanding and multiple problems and trauma that women are going through do not get a space to address and heal.  Survivor’s condition and what is being done in the present day Many women who survived the past conflict-related sexual violence considered themselves, living in a state of oppressive peace. Moreover, it has been almost two decades since the signing of the comprehensive peace accord. They question whether signing up for the peace accord is only the path to achieving peace or addressing the deep-rooted scars of conflict what they are going through is the means of achieving peace.  The government, political parties, and unaware communities consider the trauma and the suffering of women in conflict to be only women’s issues. The government failed to understand this is also a major social and national issue. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to destabilise not only women’s daily lives but also the overall social fabric of the community. Although the local government structure has the power and can influence the communities for the preparation of difficult dialogues to dismantle the systemic injustices, asymmetrical power relations, and the decade-long marginalisation that women are going through, they are not doing this.  They are mostly keeping themselves busy with infrastructure building in the name of development, but they are missing out on building the lost connection, emotional stability, and trust of women. These aspects could have contributed to bringing positive peace to the lives of these women and the overall nation. There is a major question that arises— why do the political parties and ruling government always ignore the harsh reality and context of women of conflict–related sexual violence who are still living in a state of devastation and with the systemic oppression of our society and only promoting liberal peace? The lived experience of women that failed to get the space of peace discourse resembles the legacy of conflict and is still deepening the existing scars and the new division in society due to the government’s technocratic approaches to dealing with peace issues and ineffectiveness to deal with systemic violence.  Until and unless the women will not be given a space to reimagine their upcoming lives, and frame the nuance of narratives of their true experience of the conflict, they will never be healed. In this scenario while one section of society who are genuine stakeholders to receive the peace dividends, still living in pain and injustice,  how can we imagine and nurture durable/transformative peace in our country?",political
"Nepal, EU sign grant agreement of more than Rs 10.5 billion","Kathmandu, July 21 A grant agreement of more than Rs 10.5 billion has been signed between Nepal and the  European Union  (EU) for two different programmes. During a program held at the  Finance Ministry  on Friday, two distinct financing agreements were signed. The first agreement entails a grant of 50 million pounds sterling (equivalent to Rs. 7.38 billion) dedicated to ‘Quality Education for All’ in support of the School Education Sector Plan – SESP. The second agreement involves a grant of 22 million pounds sterling (equivalent to Rs. 3.25 billion) designated for the ‘Local Adaptation to Climate Change’ initiative. Quality Education for All will support the implementation of the government’s School Education Sector Plan in a sector-wide approach (SWAP) supported by eight development partners, including the EU.

Women in politics: Redefining representation and empowering others,"Nepal transitioned into a federal state of government after the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal in 2015. One remarkable achievement since this shift has been the significant arrival of  women in politics . A total of 14,352 (40.96 per cent) elected representatives in the  2017  local election and 14,407 (41.22 per cent) elected representatives in the  2022  local election were women. Nepal Institute for Policy Research (NIPoRe)  recently completed research on ‘Nominations and Electability: The Role of Gender Norms in Nepal’s Local Elections’. The institute, with the support of Advancing Learning and Innovation in Gender Norms (ALIGN), undertook this research to bust stereotypes that are against the political engagement of Nepali women. As a part of the team, I had the chance to meet and analyse interviews that took place with more than a dozen of women in politics who have had the experience of running for elections, with some who have also been elected to the local government.  Meeting women in politics, witnessing the work they have accomplished, and listening to their aspirations gave me a sense of pride and representation as I first-hand watched women hold spaces and make decisions. Getting to know women in politics As I reflected back on the conversations that allowed me to know about women in politics from close, I was able to note similarities between them that qualify as factors that can increase meaningful political engagement of Nepali women.  It is with financial independence, support from family, and education that women can pave a political path for themselves in their community and beyond. These women have had a history of engagement in their community as they contributed to its welfare in any way possible. While some were active members of the student unions, others have remained socially active through community initiatives while a few were also a part of the Maoist insurgency.  These women in politics have since then continued their engagements as teachers, social workers, and members of women’s associations within political parties. Almost all these female politicians we interacted with came from some kind of political background and/or had parents and partners who have been supportive of their political interests.  One of the respondents from Rukum said, “When there is support from family, the society also looks at women in politics positively.” Having a supportive family does make a difference in the political participation of women, especially when one has to tackle gender norms that society at large imposes on women. Importance of financial independence and education The other factor that was largely emphasised in most of these conversations was financial independence and financial decision-making. The above-mentioned research has also stated how, according to political parties, the winnability of a candidate is defined by their ability to finance elections. National Population and Housing Census  2021  of Nepal found that only 23.8 per cent of families have their land or housing or both in the ownership of a female household member. While this is a very low percentage (although a slight increase from 2011), the bigger concern remains on the decision-making autonomy of such assets.  With limited authority and a low rate of labour force participation, managing finances for female candidates in elections is an arduous task. This acts as a limitation and barres women from running for elections despite being interested and possessing leadership ability. Another factor that the female candidates we interviewed stressed was the need for education for women and girls. When asked — What should be done to encourage more women in politics and local government?— they emphasised education. Most of them had acquired education up to or above the high school level. Four of these interviewees were engaged in the teaching profession prior to joining active politics. They shared how their educational background added as an attribute to their profile and how it build their confidence to create a political pathway for themselves. And so, efforts are needed early on to ensure more women become candidates and acquire chief executive roles in local government. In a patriarchal society that has long seen men at the forefront of politics, it isn’t an easy task to create your hold where you rightfully deserve.  The difficulty starts right at the beginning when contesting for nominations within the political parties and it persists even after. It is hence crucial that we put in efforts to build their ability and also support them throughout their political journey.",political

Bill related to loan shark victims passed by the lower house,"Kathmandu, July 17 The  House of Representatives  passed the bill related to loan shark victims on Sunday. The bill has been sent to the National Assembly after which it will be sent to the president for authentication. With the passing of the bill, loan shark victims can breathe a sigh of relief. The bill criminalises the practice of lending money by keeping people’s property as mortgages and threatening them to recover the money owed. The bill also says people cannot chard exorbitant interest rates while lending money. The government said people will be sent to prison for up to seven years and fined Rs 70,000 if they do so. If a lender has taken money or property from a borrower in an illegal manner, such as charging excessive interest, the law stipulates that the borrower is entitled to recover the actual amount of the transaction and any interest paid. The remaining balance or movable property will be returned to the borrower by the lender. This provision aims to safeguard the rights of borrowers and ensure that they are not exploited or subjected to unfair practices by lenders. The government had  inked a five-point agreement  with the loan shark victims, convincing them to end the weeks-long demonstrations in April.",political

"Despite trying, Nepali Congress’ general secretaries are falling short of expectations","While contesting for the post of general secretary in the 14th national convention of the  Nepali Congress , Gagan Thapa appealed for the party members to vote for him as he said he aimed to transform the party. Explaining the role of the general secretary, he said, “The first job of a general secretary is to enforce the party statute on all the members, including the party president.” To do so, Thapa along with his fellow general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma held a meeting with the party’s district presidents. The other objective of the meeting was to train the party about the online system adopted by the party for membership distribution and to make the party more active by conducting a conference at all levels.  According to the Nepali Congress’ statute, the role of the general secretary is to make the organisational structure of the party active and effective. They also have to disseminate information about party-related activities to the various bodies within the party when needed and implement and supervise the decisions and programs of the party. The meeting, which was called to strengthen the party, created hullabaloo within the party. Both the general secretaries were accused of holding meetings without consulting the party president.  However, general secretaries provided clarification that the meeting was conducted only after consulting with the party president which goes to show the level of influence the party president has. Hoping against hope The result of the  14th national convention that was held on December 13, 2021 , brought excitement to the party.  Although the party did not see a change in the president, there were dozens of changes in office bearers along with central members. One and a half years have passed since the convention. As the performance of the working committee is being assessed, there is also a close examination of the two general secretaries who were anticipated to drive substantial changes within the party. A key question being raised is whether Thapa and Sharma have succeeded in liberating the party from the old system that had been in place. While they have tried to create change within the party, leaders close to Thapa and Sharma say that both of them are not satisfied with their performance as general secretary.  “As a leader, they can’t blame others for not being able to work efficiently,” says a leader close to the party.  According to Ram Hari Khatiwada, a central member of the Nepali Congress, both Thapa and Sharma have failed as general secretaries as they have not played a significant role in strengthening the party. “They have not coordinated with the party president. All they have done is criticised him. That is not how you strengthen the party,” says Khatiwada who calls for the two general secretaries to take part in healthy politics. But according to anti-establishment leaders within Nepali Congress, there is a growing sense of momentum thanks to the contributions of the two general secretaries. However, they also express concerns about the duo’s perceived weakness in decision-making during general committee meetings, policy conventions, changes in the ticket distribution system, nationwide campaigns, and other key aspects. According to the statute of the Nepali Congress, the meeting of the central committee must be held once in two months. The first meeting of the central committee following the convention took place in accordance with the party’s statutes. During this meeting, the general secretaries were reportedly successful in ensuring that Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba adhered to the party’s regulations and guidelines. “But three months later, Deuba stopped following the party statute,” says an anti-establishment leader. He started postponing the issues raised by general secretaries. The meeting of the central committee which is supposed to take place once every two months was called after one year, scheduled for July 12.  The meeting of the performance committee has also been delayed as it has not met since  deciding to vote in favour of Pushpa Kamal Dahal to become the prime minister . According to the party statute, the meeting must take place every month. According to Nepali Congress leaders, Deuba tried to take the decision to vote for Dahal on his own. For that, he held a meeting of the senior leaders of the party at his residence on January 9 and 10. But the two general secretaries took a stand and held a meeting of the performance committee to discuss whether to give a vote of confidence.  Following that, the meeting was held at the Lhoste Hall of the parliament building. The majority in the meeting decided to give a vote of confidence to Dahal despite Dahal being part of the coalition with the UML. Thapa, however, was against it. He has been against the coalition since the start but he could do nothing. “We will try our best but at the end of the day, the party is more than just us. Decision on how the party moves forward is taken together,” says Thapa. Thapa before the election said  he wants to be parliamentary party leader . He tried to contest Deuba too but he was  heavily defeated by Deuba  who still holds all the cards in the Nepali Congress. Speaking at a programme on July 8, Thapa said he still has hope of becoming the parliamentary party leader someday. No help from above During this period, Deuba effectively utilised the expertise and roles of both general secretaries. He utilised Thapa to ratify the  Millennium Challenge Corporation  (MCC) in the House of Representatives. “He knew people will not be convinced if he spoke so he asked Thapa to do it,” says a central member of NC. The by-election of Tanahun 1 was considered a fight for prestige.  Swarnim Wagle , who left the party because of Deuba, was contesting against the Nepali Congress as he had joined the Rastriya Swatantra Party. To ensure he does not win, Deuba again turned to Thapa and Sharma to help in the campaign at Tanahun 1. Despite their best efforts,  Wagle won big  leaving Nepali Congress with an egg on their face. It appears that the general secretaries made efforts to activate and strengthen the party structure at all levels. In March, they issued directives for all levels, from local to provincial, to operate in accordance with the party statute. Similarly, in May, they instructed all levels to conclude their respective meetings.  Besides that, they also sent letters to wards, municipalities, provinces and districts to do meetings at all levels.  The Nepali Congress central committee also sent the format of the meeting. According to the statute, all levels must conduct a conference each year except the year of the convention.  Over two dozen districts have already concluded the meeting. The remaining districts are also actively holding the meeting, claims the party. The district presidents have committed to concluding the meeting within August. Nepali Congress has started a new practice in the party. It has begun distributing online membership. Previously, membership distribution and renewal used to be done only in the year of the convention. However, the statute disallows the distribution and renewal of membership in the year of the convention. Currently, membership renewal is taking place at the ward level. Prior to the 14th national convention, Deuba was blamed for not following the party’s statute. Deuba has not changed his ways and despite their best efforts, the general secretaries have not been able to change Deuba either. Despite the expectation of forming multiple departments within six months, only the head of the publicity department has been appointed so far. The general secretaries had made a request in June to establish at least five departments by June 25.  But their requests have been unheeded. The central committee and performance committee are not full. The central committee which is supposed to have 168 members only has 151 members.  Likewise, according to the party’s statute, there should be 46 members in the performance committee but it only has 37 so far. By now the department and the sister organisations of the Nepali Congress should have been more active. But they are not, says Khatiwada who blames the leadership for failing to hold central committee and performance committee meetings. On February 15, 2022,  10 sister organisations, including Tarun Dal and Nepal Student Union, were dissolved to form an ad hoc committee by giving a mandate to hold a convention within three months of the completion of the three-level elections. So far, only NSU has a president.   Recently a 400-member ad hoc committee of Tarun Dal was formed. Although some members have been added to the Women and Dalit Association, it has not got complete shape. In this too, general secretaries have failed to make the party president follow the party’s statute.  However, central members claim that President Deuba nominated the chair of sister organisations without informing both the general secretaries.  “President Deuba makes decisions as per his need but ignores the task necessary for the party’s benefit, ” says a central member.   This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Remembering Sita Dahal: A symbol of resilience and love,"On June 16, 2006, Home Minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula, embarked on a significant visit to Sikles in Kaski. This visit held great importance in the history of Nepali politics. Sitaula went to Sikles to invite Maoist ‘Supremo’ Pushpa Kamal Dahal, his wife Sita Dahal and other leaders to Kathmandu. This journey was made possible after Nepal’s seven major political parties and the rebel Maoist to  signed a 12-point agreement  on November 22, 2005. As Dahal prepared to depart from Sikles to Kathmandu with his wife, his fellow comrades congratulated him. However, right before his flight, he realised that he had forgotten something and quickly rushed back to his shelter to retrieve it. “You always forget one thing or another. You need to be careful or you will suffer massively in the future,” said Sita. Sita Dahal was by Pushpa Kamal’s side all her life. She saw the best and worse in him and played a major role in bringing consciousness to the supremo, who was leading the war that caused political turmoil in the country.  Whenever there was a crisis within the party, she would talk to the leaders within the party and bring calm. She knew when divided, they would fall. Her influence and counsel were instrumental in navigating challenging situations and maintaining cohesion within the party. When the Futibang meeting took place in Rolpa in August of 2004 that almost split the Maoist party, Sita was in India for treatment. When she heard about this, she quickly rushed back to Nepal and talked to both her husband and Baburam Bhattarai. “You have done a lot to reach this far and now you are willing to throw it all away over something so trivial? Have you forgotten what our goal was,” she told the two telling them they both were at fault and had weaknesses. Leaders from the Maoist Center also remember her during the party meeting at Chunbang. Sita Dahal directed her words towards both Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai, reminding them of the significant number of lives sacrificed for their cause. “This is not the way to behave at this point. You cannot do this. If you continue to disagree with each other these people will turn against you,” she told them. This is how many remember her. A fierce yet compassionate woman.  Sita Dahal’s journey has been remarkable. She went from being a housewife to an active participant in underground politics and eventually became a party member. She has risen through the ranks to assume the role of a central member and advisor within the party. No wonder most of the first-generation Maoist leaders called her bhauju (sister-in-law) and second and third-generation leaders called her mother. On Wednesday,  Sita Dahal passed away . Sita had been battling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurological disorder along with hypertension and Parkinsons’. Although her cause of death may appear as a result of her illness, it is believed that the numerous hardships and traumatic events she endured throughout her lifetime may have contributed to her ultimate demise. Marrying a comrade Sita Dahal got married to Pushpa Kamal at a fairly young age. Her family felt getting married to an educated Pushpa Kamal was best for her. During an interview a few years ago, she said how the two rarely talked during the initial months of their marriage. They were shy but gradually they created a bond of love and friendship. Life was not easy. She had to look after a family of 10 to 12 members. She had to do all the chores and being a daughter-in-law, she was always anxious about what people would think of her if she was not able to do so.  Pushpa Kamal was rarely in his home in Chitwan. He was studying in Kathmandu and later went to Gorkha to teach. During then the family was doing well but when he became a full-time Maoist rebel things started to change. As Pushpa Kamal was a known combatant, the Panchayat administration often came looking for him and harassed Sita for information. With no stable source of income and the responsibility of raising young children and managing the household fell upon her shoulders. What made things worse for her was the patriarchal society constantly nagging her for not having a son. That stopped in 1991 after she gave birth to  Prakash Dahal  after having three daughters. Prakash was only five months old when Pushpa Kamal went underground. She was tasked with the responsibility of looking after the entire family. She never complained and did so with a smile on her face. During that period, Mohan Bikram Singh served as the leader of the Maoist. Sita Dahal, recognising the lack of women’s involvement, expressed her frustration and advocated for the inclusion of women within the party.  Her voice was heard and a shift began to occur within the party, with an increasing presence of female leadership emerging. However, Sita chose to confine herself to her home, dedicating her efforts to supporting and assisting Pushpa Kamal Dahal in his political endeavours. Underground politics After a long struggle, democracy was restored in Nepal in 1990. The days of Panchayat suppression were over. Following that Sita Dahal moved to Kathmandu from Bharatpur with her four children. While she was in Kathmandu, a dispute arose within the party regarding whether the conditions were favourable for a people’s revolution. Eventually, under the leadership of Pushpa Kamal, the Maoist made the decision to declare a people’s war. This marked another significant turning point in Sita Dahal’s life. This was a major challenge as she had to find a balance between helping Pushpa Kamal and taking care of her children. Two of their daughters got married in the early years of the war in India. India became the two’s second home as they found refuge in the giant country.  But on March 26, 2004, Mohan Baidya, a member of the Maoist Standing Committee and in charge of the Eastern Command, was arrested in Siliguri by the Indian police. Following that two to returned to Rolpa. The times were challenging with bad news surfacing on the daily. After experiencing numerous ups and downs, the war eventually transitioned into a path of peaceful politics. Even when her husband served as prime minister on two occasions, Sita Dahal was not subjected to accusations of exerting excessive influence or being outspoken. On the contrary, it is believed that it is because of her calming presence that Pushpa Kamal has not encountered notable controversies during his tenure as the premier of the country. Sita Dahal had the unique opportunity to closely observe Nepali politics, witnessing firsthand the various political upheavals and controversies that unfolded among the leaders. As the prime minister’s wife, she had the opportunity to meet with powerful political leaders of the world. She became a witness to many important developments in national politics. But she was unable to tell the world about her life and what she felt like being the wife of a Maoist comrade. Sita Dahal fell ill after the demise of her eldest daughter Gyanu and her son Prakash. The two deaths left her in shock. The loss of her children had deeply affected Sita’s physical and mental well-being, and Pushpa Kamal made every effort to provide her with the necessary care and support. But she never recovered. On July 12, at 8 am she suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite the doctors’ best efforts, they were unable to revive her, and she was pronounced dead at 8:33 am.  Her passing leaves behind a profound legacy, one that may only be fully appreciated and remembered by a select few. Her impact on the political and personal spheres will be cherished by those who were fortunate enough to witness her influence and contributions.

How long will Pushpa Kamal Dahal remain prime minister? He does not know,"Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has made headlines  with a controversial statement he made on July 2. During the launch of a book by Pritam Singh in Kathmandu, Dahal mentioned Singh’s efforts to make him the prime minister of the country. “He went to Delhi to justify why I should be made prime minister,” he said during the launch. That  statement did not go down well . The main opposition, the UML, obstructed the house proceedings calling for Dahal to resign as the premier of the country. Pushpa Kamal Dahal apologised for his statement on Monday following his meeting with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML Chair KP Sharma Oli. During his address to the house, he acknowledged his emotional side and expressed guilt for his earlier remarks. “There are times I speak from my heart. That is my nature. What can I do,” he said. But as he spoke, he said inadvertently mentioned something that he had avoided discussing since his tenure as the prime minister began. He mentioned how long he will be in office as the premier of the country. Ever since becoming the prime minister, Dahal has expressed confidence that his government would create history by completing its full five-year term, implying stability and continuity. However, during his recent address, he made a remark suggesting uncertainty about the duration of his tenure as the prime minister.  This change in tone indicates a shift in perspective or circumstances that have led to a more uncertain outlook regarding the duration of his leadership. “I have never believed I will stay prime minister for a long time,” he said. “But as long as I am in the office, I will always work for the better of the country and stay alert.” Dahal even pointed out instances where world leaders had served as prime ministers for very short durations, often just 12 to 13 days. He also mentioned past examples of Nepali leaders who had held office for as little as six months. “All I can do is work for the betterment of the country. And I will do that,” he said. This is odd. Pushpa Kamal Dahal has been quite confident. Until a week ago, he confidently stated how his government would stay in power for its entirety. On July 1, at an event in Pokhara, he mentioned how strong the foundations of this government were. “We won’t be shaken. People need to note this. I will lead this government for the next five years.” This was just echoing what he has said time and again. This confidence was shared by fellow leaders of his party, the Maoist Center, and other leaders of the coalition who time and made similar statements about how strong the government was. Chair of Unified Socialists, Madhav Kumar Nepal, while talking to the editors a few weeks ago, also claimed this Dahal-led government would last five years. “This will bring stability and development to the country,” Nepal said. Nepali Congress leaders too have shown support for Dahal. Bimalendra Nidhi at a program said how it was important to support Dahal as it meant supporting the constitution. “He’s been good so far. And I believe we will carry on supporting him,” he said. Following the  dissolution of the alliance with UML , Dahal formed a new coalition with  Nepali Congress, JSPN, and Unified Socialists . During this time, there were reports suggesting that he would continue as the prime minister for a minimum of one and a half years and a maximum of three years. Despite potential adversities, there was a prevailing belief that Pushpa Kamal Dahal would unquestionably hold the position for a minimum of two years. His own confidence further reinforced this notion. During his address in the House of Representatives on July 10, Prachanda expressed his emotions in his characteristic manner and stated, “I do not anticipate being the prime minister for an extended period.”  This remark indicated a shift in his earlier confidence regarding the duration of Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s tenure.",political

Balen Shah directs private schools to provide teachers with the same salary as public schools,"Kathmandu, June 29 The Mayor of  Kathmandu metropolitan city , Balen Shah, has issued a directive to private schools operating within the metropolis calling for assurance that teachers receive salaries equivalent to those of teachers in public schools. Taking to social media today, Mayor Shah requested the teachers of private schools to contact the Kathmandu metropolitan city’s Education Department if they do not get the salary determined by the government. He shared that the city had been receiving complaints about salaries from the teachers of private schools operated in the metropolis. According to the Education Act of 1971, it is stipulated that teachers of private schools should receive salaries without any reduction in the salary scale established by the Government of Nepal. “Rule 68 of the city’s School Education Management Regulations, 2017 states that the salary, pension, gratuity, and other facilities for teachers in schools in Kathmandu should be determined in accordance with the provisions outlined in the Federal Education Law, he wrote. Shah has instructed private schools within the city to provide salaries and facilities to their teachers that are on par with those received by teachers in public schools.",political
Stagnation in Belt and Road Initiative: Nepal needs to demand clarity over projects,"A decade has passed since Nepal first showed support for China’s ambitious  Belt and Road Initiative  (BRI). It has been more than six years since Nepal signed its framework agreement. However, there is a rising sense of uncertainty surrounding the actual implementation of the initiative. There has been no progress from China when it comes to BRI projects. But, China’s claim of including projects that were initiated before the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has heightened the existing ambivalence and scepticism. This has further amplified doubts and uncertainties about the actual implementation and outcomes of the initiative in Nepal. Nepal supported the concept put forward by  Chinese President Xi Jinping in the name of One Belt One Road (OBOR) in 2013 . The project was later named the Belt and Road Initiative.  On May 12, 2017,  Nepal formally signed the Belt and Road Initiative framework agreement . The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by then-Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi and the then-Chinese Ambassador Yu Hong. The signing ceremony was attended by then Deputy Prime Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara and then Foreign Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat. Following the signing of the framework agreement, Nepal sent a high-level delegation led by the then Foreign Minister Mahara to participate in the first OBOR (One Belt, One Road) conference held in China on May 14 and 15, 2017.  Following the conference, China requested Nepal to provide a list of projects that could be implemented under the BRI. However, Nepal has faced challenges in presenting a comprehensive list of projects with detailed blueprints to fulfil this request. Former President, Bidya Devi Bhandari, in April 2019, went to Beijing to participate in the  second BRI conference . After President Bhandari participated in the BRI conference, both Nepal and China expressed enthusiasm about its implementation. Despite no tangible progress on the ground, the participation agreement in the Belt and Road Initiative has been renewed twice. The first renewal took place in 2020, three years after the initial signing, and the second renewal occurred last year. However, there is still a lack of firm consensus regarding whether to proceed with specific projects under the initiative. The decision-making process regarding project selection and implementation has encountered difficulties in reaching a solid consensus. According to Dhaniram Sharma, the spokesperson for the Finance Ministry, there has been no agreement reached on any project associated with the Belt and Road Initiative in Nepal, and thus, no implementation has taken place. “Until now, no agreement has been reached on any project. We have not taken any quotation either”, Sharma told Onlinekhabar. Nepal initially sent a list of 35 projects to the Belt and Road Initiative. Former Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali says after President Bhandari returned from participating in the second BRI conference, Nepal sent a list of those projects to China.  Later, at the request of the Chinese, Nepal reduced the number of projects to only nine and sent a list. He said after the list of those projects was sent to China and there was no response. “Nepal selected nine projects under BRI and sent them to China and discussed their investment,” Gyawali told Onlinekhabar, “I don’t know what happened after that.” To date, the government of Nepal has not provided any specific information regarding the progress made in the Belt and Road Initiative. Even officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance have refrained from making formal statements on this matter. But high-level Chinese diplomats are claiming that the projects being worked on under Chinese investment and contracts are part of the Belt and Road Initiative. BRI claim on the full project Chinese diplomats have consistently emphasised a connection between ongoing construction projects in Nepal and the Belt and Road Initiative. However, Nepal has refrained from either acknowledging or criticising the progress of the initiative, leading to a noticeable disparity in their respective stances. The lack of accountability or official response from Nepal has raised questions and underscored the importance of transparent communication to address these concerns and provide accurate information regarding the state of BRI projects in the country. According to former Finance Minister, Prakash Chandra Lohani, the government should clarify the progress being made in the Belt and Road Initiative, otherwise, it will create a negative impact on the diplomatic relationship between Nepal and China. “It is the government’s responsibility to clarify the progress made. The government should be serious about the way how China is interpreting old projects as part of the initiative,” says Lohani. “Our government should clarify the agreement and should explain what has been done and not done according to the agreement, in a diplomatic way.” Recently, China’s ambassador to Nepal, Chen Song said that Pokhara International Airport is an ambitious project of China under the Belt and Road Initiative. This is the third time the Chinese side has made this claim. Previously, the then Acting Ambassador Wang Xin had also made the same claim while addressing the opening ceremony of the airport last December. In May of the previous year, the then-Chinese Ambassador Hou Yanqi also claimed this for the first time in a press conference. She said apart from the Pokhara airport, projects such as Lumbini and Tribhuvan airports are also considered part of the Belt and Road Initiative. “All the main projects built by China in Nepal are within the framework of BRI,” she said in a virtual press conference. “First, the Gautam Buddha Airport in Lumbini. The second is Pokhara Airport. Third, Tribhuvan International Airport.” According to Lohani, even though Asian Development Bank (ADB) has invested in Lumbini Airport, China claims it as a BRI project because Chinese contractors have worked on it.  In the case of the Pokhara Airport, the funding for its construction includes commercial loans and grants from various sources, not exclusively from China. However, the construction company involved in the project was Chinese, which led China to claim it as a project under the Belt and Road Initiative. Likewise, while the cost of upgrading the Tribhuvan International Airport was covered by the Nepali government, the responsibility for the project was entrusted to a Chinese company. As a result, it has been considered a part of the initiative as well.  Not only are the projects being built with Chinese grants or loans, but Hou Yanqi said that the projects contracted by Chinese companies are also being built under the BRI. According to former foreign minister Gyawali, it is wrong for powerful countries to misinterpret old projects as projects under strategic projects such as BRI. Chandra Ghimire, the former commerce secretary of the Nepal government, says that the government should be serious about this matter.  “The MCC issue was later linked to the Indo-Pacific, so if China says that the old projects were built under its strategic projects, it will cause geo-political and economic problems. So the government needs to be serious about this,” says Ghimire. China’s claims contradict the concept of BRI So far, China does not seem to be interested to talk about BRI in formal forums or meetings with Nepal. Following the dissolution of the parliament by KP Sharma Oli, Nepal has witnessed a surge in geopolitical interest, including increased engagement from China. Chinese Senior Diplomat and then  Foreign Minister Wang Yi  and speaker of the Chinese Congress  Li Zhanshu also came to Nepal . However, none of them openly discussed the BRI. Instead, China has expressed its interest in bridging the widening gap and strengthening ties with Nepal. Lately, official and unofficial visits have also been made to Beijing from Nepal. Recently, former foreign minister Narayan Khadka visited China. Apart from that, Ganesh Timilsina, who is currently a chair of the National Assembly, has returned to Nepal after visiting China. There has not been any official statement released regarding the discussion and progress made on BRI during these visits. In terms of party, leaders of the Maoist Center and UML have visited China several times. Discussions during those visits cannot be considered formal. But Chinese diplomats are claiming that the old project is under BRI, ignoring the issues mentioned in the concept put forward by their own president. According to the concept of BRI, China has mentioned that projects will be selected through its five pillars and three stages.  Those areas are:  As per the concept of the Belt and Road Initiative, the project selection process involves two governments in the initial phase.  In the second stage, Chinese government-controlled companies undertake a study of the project’s commercial feasibility.  Subsequently, in the third stage, Chinese government banks provide loans for the approved projects. Only after these steps are completed, the strategic project is initiated in accordance with the BRI concept. To date, even the first phase of the Belt and Road Initiative implementation, which involves the selection of projects by two governments, has not been completed. As Nepal and China have not yet chosen any specific projects under the BRI, the progress in terms of project implementation appears to be stalled.",political

"Living in fear, Prem Chalaune’s fight for justice continues","“For the last three years, I was expecting justice from the court. That was my only hope. But the government withdrew my case. Where do I go to seek justice now,” asked Prem Chalaune, from the premises of Kathmandu District Court.  In October 2020, assistant professor of  Tribhuvan University ,  Prem Chalaune, was assaulted by seven students , including Hari Acharya and Yogendra Rawal, associated with the  Nepal Students Union , the student wing of Nepali Congress, at campus premises. He sustained critical injuries, including a fractured right leg and deep cuts on his head and left leg. He was admitted to the hospital for two months and walked with the help of crutches for a long time.  “All I see are nightmares nowadays. In the nightmares, I am straggled by three people who came into my room through the window. Then, I feel suffocated and start screaming in real,” says Chalaune. The situation has taken a turn for the worse as the government has decided to withdraw his case. This development has intensified his concerns, causing him greater distress than before. “I am constantly living in fear,” says Chalaune. What happened? Chalaune should be in class teaching. But the assistant professor, for the last three years, has been roaming around the court, looking for justice.  But, the government tried to block any legal recourse for him. The government was fighting the case on his behalf but without informing him, it abruptly withdrew the  case drawing criticism from all sectors.  As that happened, it left him hopeless as he was confused about where he needed to go to seek justice for what a few members of the NSU did to him nearly three years ago. The process to withdraw Prem Chalaune’s case began last year. Acharya, Rawal, and five other students submitted an application to the District Administration Office, requesting the withdrawal of the case, even though no witness statements were presented. The police investigations had already stated Acharya and Rawal were the masterminds behind the attack and they were accompanied by Dipak Raj Joshi, Rupesh Shah, Rabin Kumar Lama, Suyaj Shrestha and Niraj Rana Magar.  After Acharya and Rawal submitted the application to DAO, the Nepali Congress Kathmandu District Working Committee and Nepal Student Union, also submitted an application to the  Peace, Security and Crime Control Section  of the Ministry of Home Affairs, demanding it withdraw the case.    Following that, the Ministry of Home Affairs sent a letter to the Kathmandu District Public Prosecutor’s Office asking them to take necessary actions to advance the process of withdrawing Chalaune’s case, arguing that peace and security would be disturbed by not withdrawing the case. Tek Narayan Pandey, the then Home Secretary, issued an order to the Kathmandu District Public Prosecutor’s Office, instructing them to take necessary action on the application submitted by the Nepali Congress Kathmandu District Working Committee. Bal Krishna Khand, a Congress leader, held the position of Home Minister during the ongoing process of withdrawing the case. Both Khand and Pandey currently find themselves in police custody as they face accusations in the Bhutanese refugee scam. Both  Khand and Pandey are currently in police custody  for being accused in the  fake Bhutanese refugee scam. Ever since the Patan High Court released Acharya, Rawal and the other six on bail of Rs 500,000 On February 25, 2021, Chalaune expressed concerns about his personal safety, indicating that he does not feel secure. Following their release, Acharya and Rawal have asked Khand and other high-profile leaders to withdraw the case.  Wait and watch scenario Chalaune is undergoing regular physiotherapy sessions. But he is frustrated as he is forced to spend his time in hospitals and courts instead of being able to focus on his teaching responsibilities. Chalaune, who teaches Introduction to Sociology – Marxism and Neo-Marxism, found himself occupied with reading clauses and articles a year ago when he learned that his case was slated for withdrawal. Unfortunately, all his efforts were in vain as the government has decided to withdraw the case, thereby undermining his struggle. “The government has politicised the crime and criminalised the politics,” says Chalaune.   With the government’s decision to withdraw the case, victims of criminal cases have been left disheartened, as it has undermined their confidence in the government’s commitment to support them. In accordance with Section 116 of the National Civil Code Act, even if the government decides to withdraw the case, the relevant court should also issue an order for the withdrawal of the case. But that has not happened yet. After all these hurdles from the government, Chalune asks, “Where should I go to find justice?”  Chalaune has had a small respite as the Supreme Court, on June 22,  issued an interim order  telling the government not to withdraw Chalaune’s case. Chalaune had gone to the apex court asking it to annul the decision taken by the government. He said that the government’s decision to withdraw the case was not logical and was of a nature to protect criminals, and demanded that the government’s decision should be stopped immediately.

Is the new emergence of new political parties a growing concern or a satirical reflection for old parties?,"Despite the implementation of the  federal structure in Nepal , all political parties in the country have no fulfilled peoples’ expectations for accelerated development, guaranteed rights, and inclusive representation. In the recent election,  citizens chose the new faces and new parties  as they did not believe in the manifesto of established political parties. This has polarised the Nepali political scenario.  Now the question is — have citizens expressed their discontent or resorted to satirical means to criticise the established political parties?  Unfavourable state for established political parties  The 2022 elections had a surprising twist as the emergence of new political parties and leaders shifted the balance of power in their favour. The general public lacking trust in the top leaders poses a significant threat to the sustainability of the political landscape. The people do not trust the government taking important decisions. They also feel the government cannot justify the decision it takes. With efforts to combat corruption insufficient and ineffective, people are growing more and more frustrated with the status quo. Despite the people’s expectations, infrastructure development has fallen short, and the country’s economy remains in a state of decline. The continuous struggles of the stock market have further deepened the disappointment among the populace towards the Nepal political parties. As a result, Nepal finds itself in a depressing condition due to these collective factors as more and more people are leaving the country every day. The citizens’ psychology towards current political scenarios and leaders can be seen through the posts made on social media. Their views and opinion signal their disappointment towards the established political parties.  The results of both  the general election  and the  by-election have clearly indicated  the frustration of supporters belonging to established political parties like the Nepali Congress, UML, and Maoist.  These supporters have shifted their allegiance towards new political parties, driven by hopes for a change. The victorious candidates secured a significant number of votes, which can potentially generate satire or pose a threat to established political parties. The craze for an alternative political party  The level of frustration or irritation is not only limited to general people. It can be seen in the faces of the leaders of the political parties and their loyal followers. What frustrates people, even more, is most decision made by political parties happens in a centralised manner without proper discussions within the party. This has resulted in  many switching the party  they have represented in search of another one where their voice is heard and are given a fair chance. If such a scenario continues, it poses a threat to the presidents and chairpersons of established political parties, accompanied by a wave of satire and criticism. The emergence of the  Rastriya Swatantra Party  (RSP) as the fourth most influential political party in Nepal cannot be overlooked. With 21 lawmakers who claim to possess highly qualified degrees, the party’s popularity, particularly under the leadership of Rabi Lamichhanne, has reached an unprecedented height Candidates of the RSP have defeated senior leaders in the election with relatively new faces. The newly elected lawmakers are making efforts to raise their voices using a fresh approach and new concepts. On the other hand, those members who have had multiple terms in the parliament are still following the traditional path. Despite citizens’ intentions to elect lawmakers who can endorse good governance, development activities, and anti-corruption movements in the parliament, the old political leaders have not been able to fulfil that role disappointing those that voted for them. It seems that most of the parliament members play their roles in the traditional way by following their leaders as they do not appear to be strong enough to check and balance the government. Many political parties tend to either strongly support or oppose the government, which frequently results in disillusionment among citizens. This challenging situation creates an atmosphere of intimidation within Nepali politics. Having been frustrated with the parties they voted for, the public has shifted their focus towards young and fresh faces in politics. This growing inclination towards new leaders poses a threat to established parties and invites satire directed at the politicians involved. The lack of substantial accomplishments of these parties during all these years has further contributed to this sentiment.",political
Supreme Court orders govt not to withdraw Prem Chalaune’s case,"Kathmandu, June 21 The  Supreme Court  has issued an interim order telling the government not to withdraw Prem Chalaune’s case.

With the order of the court, the statement given by the government lawyers to the district court to withdraw the case has become ineffective. The government can go to the Supreme Court demanding the cancellation of the interim order if it is not satisfied with the order. Chalaune had gone to the apex court asking it to annul the decision taken by the government.

CIAA seeks authorisation to investigate both public and private organisations,"Kathmandu, June 18 The  Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority  (CIAA) has requested the government to grant it the authority to investigate corruption within private organisations and non-government originations. CIAA expresses concerns over the lack of clarity in addressing corruption in various organisations. Secretary at CIAA, Rameshwor Dangal, at a meeting of the State Affairs and Coordination Committee of the National Assembly, said that there is a problem in reducing corruption effectively as there was no government body to look into improper activities at these organisations. Dangal also asked the CIAA bill, which is in the parliament, to be moved forward quickly. “The act needs changes according to today’s time. The bill that is tabled in the house has the necessary changes,” said Dangal. The  National Assembly has passed the CIAA bill  and forwarded it to the House of Representatives.

Is the unopened EPG report Pandora’s box?,"The visit of  Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to India , upon the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is considered highly significant within Nepal’s political landscape. Dahal, accompanied by a massive delegation of 120 members, spent four days in India during his visit. Dahal’s India visit carried significant expectations. The Maoist Centre’s consistent stance of maintaining an alliance with the Congress and progressing together suggests that he enjoys the complete support of the alliance during this visit. His visit to Delhi, occurring amidst increasing US influence and China’s interest in Nepal, holds significant meaning. New Delhi is closely observing the  expanding US engagement in Nepal , and India, much like China, might be taken aback by the US military initiatives aimed at advancing the proposed military agreement under the  State Partnership Program  (SPP). Dahal highlighted the importance of resolving issues between the two countries through diplomatic means. He has time and again talked about reviewing the India–Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950, but during his recent visit, he did not bring it up. When the Maoists initiated the People’s War in 1996, they initially raised the issue of nullifying the Nepal-India Treaty of 1950. However, there seems to be a significant disparity between what he said back then and his subsequent action. The adoption of the report prepared by the  Nepal-India Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG)  is crucial for strengthening and advancing the relationship between the two countries. Both Nepal and India have known this for years. But no discussions took place during the bilateral and delegation-level meetings between the two Prime Ministers concerning the  EPG report , the  Agneepath scheme  or the 1950 treaty. Formation of EPG  Both Dahal and Modi have consistently emphasised the strength of the relationship between Nepal and India, stressing the importance of resolving any issues through diplomatic means. The Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG), consisting of foreign affairs experts from both Nepal and India, was established with the purpose of addressing these issues. The group was tasked with studying and conducting the necessary groundwork to adapt Nepal-India relations to the changing global landscape of the 21st century. Prior to his visit to India, Dahal and his team were advised to prioritise the understanding and utilisation of the report prepared jointly by both countries. Additionally, his team was urged to initiate a dialogue with Modi and India in order to implement the recommendations put forward by the EPG. One of the reasons the EPG was created was to provide recommendations for reviewing the contentious 1950 treaty between Nepal and India. Along with that, the group successfully fulfilled its assigned  responsibilities related to other bilateral agreements on July 16, 2018. EPG’s report for future prospect  The relationship between Nepal and India is diverse. The EPG has delved into diverse issues as it focused on areas such as business, commerce, and immigration. There are reports that suggest the team has comprehensively studied the 1950 treaty and presented recommendations in its report. But with the report still not released, people in Nepal are hoping that the group has provided specific and practical recommendations regarding the revision of the treaty. In addition to the treaty, the EPG is also anticipated to address various other significant matters such as border management, security and sharing water resources. The Nepali group was led by former foreign minister Bhekh Bahadur Thapa and included Rajan Bhattarai, Nilambar Acharya and Surya Nath Upadhyay. The Indian group was led by Bhagat Singh Kosiyari, Jayant Prasad, Mahendra P Lama and Bhuwan Chandra Upreti. The report produced by the EPG is expected to be of great historical significance. The group of distinguished individuals has collaboratively prepared a comprehensive document aimed not only at elevating the relationship between the two countries to new heights but also at considering the interests of future generations. Once the report is submitted to the Prime Ministers and released, it is expected that further discussions on various issues will ensue, potentially leading to more criticism and assessment. As this committee’s mandate is limited to providing suggestions on non-political matters, it is believed the report has been prepared to encompass all relevant subjects. Nepal and India have a common interest when it comes to border regulation as it will help combat terrorism, extremism, fanaticism, illicit currency, drug trafficking, and smuggling. This will definitely help both countries. If the recommendations of the EPG report are implemented, it is expected that both Nepal and India will demonstrate adaptability and flexibility, while considering the interests of both sides. By adopting this positive and friendly approach, there is a strong potential to bolster and improve the relationship between the two countries. Most Nepalis feel the 1950 treaty is unequal and imbalanced as leftists in Nepal have repeatedly called for a revision or revocation. The treaty has also been a subject of frequent controversy and debate, with various parties in Nepal calling for its amendment, repeal, or replacement with a new treaty.  However, during his recent trip, Dahal did not address reviewing the treaty. He is not alone as previous prime ministers have also refrained from holding discussions with India regarding the treaty. It is possible that the purpose of the trip was mainly to create a positive public image or garner public support, rather than to address substantial issues or concerns. But why did not Dahal, the prime minister of Nepal, strongly advocate for the acceptance, acknowledgement and implementation of the Nepal-India EPG report? There could be various factors. Political considerations, diplomatic sensitivities, and strategic negotiations between the two countries might influence the public stance taken by the two Prime Ministers. While it may appear that the discussions on the EPG report, treaty, and border issues by Dahal are primarily to create a positive public image, it is important to consider the complex dynamics and negotiations involved in bilateral relations. Many high-level visits have been made between Nepal and India since the EPG completed its work, but the report itself reached a  state of confusion . Why? There are talks that the issue at hand is undoubtedly influenced by the interests of the Indian establishment, which can play a significant role in shaping the outcome of discussions and decisions. A treaty that seems unequal to Nepal does not seem unequal to India. Nepal’s border has been encroached on, but India has not. Villages in Nepal sink due to structures built by India along the border while it does not affect Indian villages.  While advising and engaging in dialogue with India is important, there may also be a need for putting pressure to address the specific issues and challenges faced by Nepal.  This was Dahal’s first visit to India after he became prime minister. A memorandum of understanding was signed between Dahal and his counterpart Modi on  seven different issues in New Delhi during the visit .   The governments have reached an agreement on the construction of integrated check post infrastructure at Chandni Dodhara. The Nepal-India transit agreement has also been renewed with amendments. No one knows why the details of the EPG report have been kept confidential. However, it is possible to speculate that this decision was made out of concern that opening the report could potentially lead to the emergence of various problems, akin to the story of  Pandora’s Box in ancient Greek mythology . Just as Pandora’s Box unleashed pain and suffering upon humanity, there may be concerns that the report’s contents could lead to unforeseen complications or disputes.",political

Nepal and India border dispute: Important lessons from Bangladesh before considering land swapping,"Prime Minister  Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s four-day official visit  to India from May 31 to June 3 has been touted as a successful trip by the state media in terms of the  goodwill shown by India’s PM Narendra Modi  towards the resolution of outstanding border disputes between Nepal and India through  bilateral diplomatic mechanisms. The  Limpiyadhura-Lipulekh-Kalapani  sector dispute, which is a major territorial dispute that encompasses an area of around 400 square kilometres, can be viewed as a ‘frozen’ dispute that has been an irritant in the relations between India and Nepal, especially since the Indian occupation of Kalapani after the 1962  Sino-Indian War . This is a very strategic area for India from a military point of view, but for Nepal, this is a loss of territory that defines its sovereignty and independence. Dahal is positive that the issue can be solved  as during his recent visit, Modi proposed to swap lands between the two countries like India did with Bangladesh. But it is not going to be easy as the land Nepal will likely want to swap, is currently occupied by the Indian military. In Nepal, there is speculation that the land swaps on the Indian side are related to the territories within the 52 km  Siliguri Corridor , which can serve as a connection between Nepal and Bangladesh and is often known as the Chicken’s Neck. If history is anything to go by, land swap is going to be a disputed issue in both Nepal and India as prime ministers from both countries will be challenged by political leaders and citizens. Details are not yet clear. If land swaps are to be carried out fairly, India will need to exchange lands that are located within the Chicken’s Neck area, which consists of a 20km by 20km strip of land. This is a daunting task as the sovereignty and independence of Darjeeling in West Bengal, will also be affected.  Since West Bengal is ruled by Mamata Banerjee’s  All India Trinamool Congress , which was actively involved in challenging land swap negotiations with Bangladesh, the Indian state government will hold significant influence over any land swap agreements. In certain cases, particularly regarding  water-sharing treaties  with Bangladesh, the state government has not always followed the directives of the central government, resulting in delays in treaty signings. India has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Nepal,  aiming to import 10,000 MW of electricity over the course of the next decade . It is understood that Nepal will initially  export 50 MW of electricity to Bangladesh , and in the future, there is a possibility of additional exports beyond the 10,000 MW that Nepal plans to sell to India over the next decade. But that is an afterthought, as Nepalis are questioning whether the land swaps will be conducted with fairness and equality. They believe that the crucial details need careful consideration, and Nepal should engage its experts to thoroughly prepare and negotiate the land swaps. The government is accountable to the people and should be open to renegotiation if necessary. The following is an overview of the Bangladesh-India Model for resolving disputes concerning land, river, and maritime boundaries between Nepal and India.  The two countries can resolve disputes through bilateral negotiations, third-party intervention, or by seeking recourse in the  International Court of Justice  (ICJ). India and Bangladesh have utilised both bilateral talks and the ICJ to address their boundary issues. The case studies presented below highlight a multifaceted approach that was effectively employed in settling boundary disputes between India and Bangladesh, which Nepal can learn from. A glimpse of Bangladesh-India border issues and their resolutions The 4,156-km-long international border between India and Bangladesh is of the  longest land border in the world . Both India and Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) inherited their borders from colonial times during the  British Raj in South Asia . Their international border follows the Radcliffe Line, which was defined by the British architect and chairman of the Border Commission Sir Cyril Radcliffe during the partition of India in 1947. A new nation Bangladesh, which was born in December 1971 after the  Liberation War , signed the  Land Boundary Agreement  (LBA) with India in 1974. Although the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the founding father of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman signed the LBA, it was ratified only in 2011 by India.  A revised version of the agreement was  adopted by the two countries on May 7, 2015 , when the Parliament of India passed the 119th Amendment to the Indian Constitution and the revised LBA was signed on June 6, 2015, in Bangladesh.  Five Indian states share their international border with Bangladesh: 262 km in Assam, 856 km in Tripura, 180 km in Mizoram, 443 km in Meghalaya and 2,217 km in West Bengal. The Bangladesh divisions of Mymensingh, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Sylhet and Chittagong are situated along the border. Under the LBA, the two countries also agreed to exchange enclaves and adverse possessions, which were the outstanding border issues, which were agreed to be resolved in the 1958 Nehru-Noon Accords.  There were 111 Indian enclaves (17,160.63 acres) within Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves (7,110.02 acres) within India. The residents in the enclaves were given a choice either to reside in the enclaves or to move to the country of their preference after the exchanges. As far as adverse possessions were concerned, India received 2,777.038 acres of land and transferred 2267.682 acres to Bangladesh. As a result of the land swap, Bangladesh gained more territory than India. There are different tales surrounding the origin of the enclaves. Some suggest that they were formed during intense card games or chess matches long ago between two local kings, the Raja of Cooch Behar and the Maharaja of Rangpur. While others say it is a result of a botched expansion of the Mughal empire.  There are also some who say a drunk British officer sprinkled ink on a map and some call this territorial accident, a result of a careless division of Bengal by Radcliffe who delimited the boundaries based on rough sketches.  Whatever the reasons, the problems regarding the enclaves were successfully sorted out and sealed during the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bangladesh in 2015 and the return visit of the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) to India in 2017. These 11 maps show how India encroached upon Nepali land In 1982, as part of the LBA between India and Bangladesh, a lease was granted indefinitely to Bangladesh for the Tin Bigha Corridor—a land bridge measuring 170 meters in length. This corridor connects Dahagram-Angarpota, the largest Bangladeshi enclave situated within India’s Cooch Behar district. As part of the agreement, Bangladesh ceded Berubari. After years of nationalistic and communal politics in both India and Bangladesh, as well as the removal of General Mohammed Ershad from power in Bangladesh, the Tin Bigha Corridor was partially opened on June 26, 1992. Subsequently, on October 19, 2011, the corridor was made accessible 24 hours a day. Explainer: What is the Kalapani controversy between Nepal and India all about? Bangladesh has around 400 rivers. It shares 54 transboundary rivers with India, the most famous ones being the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Teesta (GBT). India is the upper riparian country, whereas Bangladesh is the lower riparian country. Bangladesh has riverine water disputes with India regarding the diversion of water from the Ganges, Teesta and other transboundary rivers. Bangladesh encounters significant obstacles in mitigating floods during the monsoon season and coping with droughts in the dry season. In August 1988, during the rainy season, devastating floods ravaged Bangladesh, submerging nearly two-thirds of the country. In August 2019, India and Bangladesh held a water secretary-level meeting of the Joint River Commission (JRC) in Dhaka. During the meeting, the two countries agreed to collect data and prepare water-sharing agreements for seven rivers—Manu, Muhure, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Duhkumar and Feni. India is confronted with a significant strategic challenge in its northeastern region due to the growing influence of China in Bangladesh. Given recent reports of  China’s intention to construct dams on the Brahmaputra river  in Tibet, there is a potential for India and Bangladesh to collaborate on water-sharing agreements concerning the river. Here is the explanation of how the transboundary rivers and water disputes were resolved between Bangladesh and India : The Ganges river enters Bangladesh through the Nawabganj district, where it spans the international border with India for approximately 110km. It continues to flow within Bangladesh for about 130km until it meets the Jamuna River. The width of the river ranges from 1.5km to 14km. Notably, the river experiences an average annual erosion rate of 10 square kilometres per year. In 1975, India constructed the Farrak Barrage over the Ganges River in West Bengal. Its purpose was to prevent siltation in Hooghly port and divert water towards Kolkata. However, this led to water scarcity in northwestern Bangladesh during the dry season. The barrage is situated 90 km away from the Bangladeshi border. In December 1996, both countries signed a 30-year treaty to share Ganges water, which was based on a formula determining the flow at Farraka during the lean season annually. : This is a transboundary river that has its source in the Himalayas. It flows through the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal and joins the Jamuna river in Bangladesh. India constructed a barrage over the Teesta at Gazoldoba and started withdrawing water from it. India’s water withdrawal from the Teesta has led to a reduction in water flow during the dry season (November to May). According to Bangladesh, the decreased water availability caused by these factors has led to reduced rice production in the Teesta and Brahmaputra river basins. In 1983, India and Bangladesh reached an ad-hoc agreement for sharing water, with India receiving 39 per cent, Bangladesh receiving 36 per cent, and the remaining 25 per cent left unallocated. The water-sharing agreement for the Teesta river saw a positive shift in 2015 following a change in the Indian government and the agreement of Mamata Banerjee, leader of the Trinamool Congress, to support the central government of India in establishing a fair water-sharing agreement. : This river, located in southeastern Bangladesh, is a transboundary river that originates in southern Tripura. It flows through Sabroom town before entering Ramgarh in Bangladesh, continuing its course through the country until it reaches the Bay of Bengal. India is currently constructing a 150-meter-long, 4-lane  bridge over the Feni river , which serves as a boundary river. The primary objective behind this project is to enhance economic integration between India’s North Eastern Region and its mainland.  The bridge will connect Tripura with the Chittagong port in Bangladesh, located just 70 kilometres from the India-Bangladesh border. This connectivity holds significant importance within the proposed economic corridor that spans India, Bangladesh, China, and Myanmar. Additionally, the development is expected to transform Sabroom into a prominent economic and transit hub. The river is navigable by small boats as far as Ramgarh in India, about 80 km upstream. Bangladesh has been dealing with an unresolved border issue with India concerning a riverine boundary since the river changed its course between 2004 and 2006.  As a result, previously fertile land that belonged to Bangladesh now lies within Indian territory. India supports following the new course of the river, while Bangladesh maintains its position based on the old course. There have been discussions regarding the possibility of constructing an embankment to redirect the river to its original course. In 2019, both governments signed an MOU to address the issue by allowing the withdrawal of 1.82 cusec water from the Feni river. This water is intended for drinking purposes for the people of Sabroom in Tripura. : Muhari is a riverine border between India and Bangladesh. This river has its source in the Lushai hills and enters Bangladesh through the Feni district before discharging into the Bay of Bengal.  The primary dispute between India and Bangladesh regarding Muhari revolves around the method of demarcation. Bangladesh proposed resolving the issue based on the Chakla Roshnabad Map of 1893, while India insisted on using the 1854 and 1892 maps. This difference in preferred maps has contributed to the ongoing disagreement between the two countries. Due to a natural shift in the river’s course, a char (islet) or surfaced area was formed, which now occupies a significant portion of land on the Indian side. However, Bangladesh asserts its claim over this territory.  In an effort to address their border disputes, the two countries are engaged in debates regarding the application of the Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers (1967), which could potentially assist in finding a resolution to their disagreements. Maritime boundary resolutions at the Bay of Bengal The long-standing  sea boundary dispute between Bangladesh and India in the Bay of Bengal  was resolved after more than three decades. On July 7, 2014, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) issued its ruling, favoring Bangladesh.  As per the ruling, Bangladesh was awarded 19,467 km2 of the disputed areas out of the total 25,602 km2 in the Bay of Bengal. This decision, binding on both countries, was reached after extensive arguments, counter-arguments, site visits by judges, and examination of submitted documents over a period of approximately five years. India and Myanmar advocated for delimiting Bangladesh’s maritime boundary based on the equidistance principle, while Bangladesh sought equitable solutions. Another issue between Bangladesh and India was the ownership claim over the newly formed island, known as South Talpatti to Bangladesh and New Moor Island to India. This 5 km2 island emerged after a cyclone in 1970 near the mouth of the border river Hariabhanga. The resolution of the dispute involved considering the main flow of the river to determine the ownership of the island. .",political

The future of democracy in Nepal: Addressing the challenges preserving the gains of the past,"Different dynasties ruled Nepal since the 7th century BC. However, early in the 1950s, a democratic movement overthrew the Rana regime that ruled the country for more than 100 years. Then in 1990, a multiparty parliament with King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah as the head of state and an executive prime minister was founded.  While the parliamentary democracy in Nepal was affected by the  decade-long Maoist war , shortly afterwards, King Gyanendra was installed as a ruler in 2001. After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in November 2006 and the Constituent Assembly (CA) elections in 2008, Nepal was proclaimed a federal democratic republic. However, the first CA was unable to complete the historic duty of drafting a constitution and was dissolved in 2012. Following the earthquake in April 2015, political parties were under pressure to speed up the constitution-writing process. Finally, on September 20, 2015, the new constitution was ratified by a resounding majority of voters, fulfilling the long-held desire of the Nepali people for a constitution to be created by an elected representative body. Henceforth, democracy in Nepal has undoubtedly come a long way. However, the nation is still dealing with serious issues that could undo the progress gained over these past years. As Nepal moves forward, it is crucial to address these challenges and preserve the gains of the past to ensure a brighter future for its citizens.  So what are the current political challenges for Nepal? Corruption The Bhutanese refugee crisis in Nepal is a complex and protracted issue that has been ongoing since the early 1990s. Recently, this case has been recirculating in the international media because a group of swindlers led by Keshav Dulal and Sanu Bhandari stole a committee report,  changed the number of refugees to 875 from 429 , and added 18 pages before disseminating it to entice individuals to the US under the pretence of being Bhutanese refugees. Corruption for long has had a detrimental impact on democracy in Nepal as well as its development and undermined the trust and confidence of people in their government. With such a high-profile case surfacing through all media, questioning the accountability of Nepali leaders, it has caused a significant humanitarian crisis and disillusionment among people. Environmental degradation The  AQI  has frequently ranked Kathmandu as the  city with the most toxic air  in the world. This has taken a significant toll on the public’s health. From reduced visibility in and outside the city to irritable eyes to increased risk of respiratory diseases, lost productivity due to illness, along with reduced cognitive function and developmental delay in children, the air quality in Kathmandu has become a major concern for the health and well-being of its residents.  You might be wondering how is this a threat to democracy in Nepal. But think this way. Politicians may be allowed to misuse government finances to travel to Australia for a month, but where are the rest of us supposed to go? How are we going to pay for this luxury if we can’t afford basic healthcare? Economic crisis and inflation In the current fiscal year, imports have decreased by about 18 per cent and the trade deficit has decreased by 17 per cent. But its toll has been seen on the government’s revenue as collection has gone down by 12.62 per cent compared to last year. In terms of government finances, this is the  worst situation since the fiscal year 1967/68 . A serious liquidity problem has been affecting Nepal’s banks and financial institutions. More than 13 billion Indian rupees’ worth of interest on loans still owes repayment. Nepal is facing a shortage of INR 20 billion to facilitate pension distribution of the many teachers and civil servants in the state which has perpetuated poverty and led to high levels of unemployment. Without the concentrated efforts from the government, private sector, civil society and international partners, the prosperous economy of the nation seems to be in question. It does not need any explanation that the economy affects all other sectors of life, from individual to global levels. Hence, democracy in Nepal continues to be threatened for want of money.  Human rights violation A 16-year-old boy was brutally beaten up by a man,  Ram Binek Yadav , in Gaushala municipality, Manhottari for simply having a meal with an upper caste. Such is the  deeply-rooted traditional caste system  in Nepal, till this day and age. This is also a violation of human rights.  You know democracy and human rights go hand in hand. Hence, the violation of human rights continuing is synonymous with democracy in Nepal being under threat. Other threats Geographical barriers, high costs, complex legal procedures, corruption and delays in the justice system are other challenges to democracy in Nepal. They have resulted in limited access to justice and the judicial system, particularly for marginalised and disadvantaged communities as such. This has contributed to a lack of accountability and perpetuated injustice in the country. Evidently enough, Nepal has been striving to consolidate its democratic system. However, addressing such socio-economic disparities, promoting inclusive growth and civic education, fostering consensus-building, safeguarding human rights and promoting good governance plays a crucial role in further shaping the future of democracy in Nepal.",political

Why is the US report on religious freedom 2022 talked about in Nepal? Is it really biased?,"The  2022 Report on International Religious Freedom , published by the US Department of State, has garnered significant attention in the media. This influential report, released annually since 1999, has identified 17 countries as countries of particular concern (CPC). The report on religious freedom issued by the US government this year faced opposition from  India  and  China,  with both countries criticising the report and labelling it as biased. India’s External Affairs Ministry and China’s authorities have voiced their concerns regarding the report’s objectivity. Nepal’s Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that the government of Nepal has also already sent a  diplomatic note to the United States  expressing its disagreement with the content mentioned about Nepal. So, what does the American report on religious freedom consist of that is significant in Nepal’s context? Is it biased? Hard on Hindus, soft on Christians The recently released report on religious freedom by the US State Department has been subject to scrutiny due to allegations of bias regarding its portrayal of religious freedom in Nepal. Critics argue that the report primarily relies on media reports, giving undue emphasis to the concerns of the Christian community while potentially overlooking the broader religious landscape in the country. The report highlights instances where religious freedom has allegedly been curtailed in Nepal, focusing specifically on the Christian minority. It underscores the constitutional definition of secularism in Nepal, which is interpreted as safeguarding customs and traditions from the past. However, critics argue that this portrayal may not fully capture the complexities of religious dynamics and the experiences of other religious groups in the country. One area of contention revolves around the mention of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s agenda, which seeks to establish Nepal as a Hindu nation and potentially revive a monarchy. While Christians have expressed concern over this agenda, it is important to contextualise these concerns within the broader religious fabric of Nepal. It is crucial to approach the report on religious freedom with a critical lens, recognising that media reports may not provide a comprehensive understanding of religious freedom issues in Nepal. By acknowledging the diverse religious landscape and taking into account the perspectives of various religious communities, a more balanced assessment can be made. Furthermore, the report on religious freedom claims that Nepali political leaders receive financial support from Indian political parties, specifically the BJP. However, it is important to note that the report does not provide any concrete data or evidence to substantiate this conclusion. Without verifiable information, it is challenging to draw definitive conclusions regarding such claims. It is crucial to approach such allegations with caution and ensure the availability of credible evidence before making any judgments. Silence about the increased activities of Christians The report on religious freedom appears to have overlooked the increased activities of Christians in Nepal, as  reported by the BBC . This omission may raise questions about the report’s comprehensiveness and balance in presenting the religious landscape in Nepal. While it is important to include diverse perspectives, such as those from civil society members and media reports, in assessing religious freedom, it is equally crucial to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased representation of the situation on the ground. The focus of the report on religious freedom on highlighting the plight of Christians and their perceived persecution, while neglecting the views of Nepali Buddhist followers, could be seen as presenting a biased perspective. An organisation called Global Mission Nepal, with its  goal of “one village and one church ” in Nepal by 2030, was not captured within the context of the report. These news stories shed light on the activities of missionaries and highlight concerns that their activities may be contributing to the weakening of Nepal’s ancient traditions and culture. Why lecture others? The United States often assumes a dominant role in determining what is considered right or wrong globally. However, a closer examination of historical instances reveals the US undermining human rights issues. This has been once again proved by the recent report on religious freedom.  Countries like the United Kingdom, where the monarchy is viewed as the protector of the Christian religion, and the United States, where presidents take oaths while touching the Bible, may lack the moral authority to lecture other nations on freedom of religion. Moreover, certain Western countries have been selective in accepting refugees, granting preferential treatment to individuals from Ukraine based on their Christian faith and ethnicity, which raises questions about the intentions of the West. Additionally, there have been instances during the Covid pandemic when certain Western nations have been accused of humiliating Asians, as reported by various media outlets. The prevalence of gun violence in American elementary schools raises questions about the country’s commitment to upholding human rights. The tragic loss of life, particularly among innocent children, poses a significant threat to fundamental human rights. In particular, the rights to life, health, education, and peaceful assembly are being violated within the United States. As the nation seeks to advocate for human rights internationally, it is imperative to address these pressing concerns at home before engaging in global discourses such as the report on religious freedom. It is true that historical actions and policies of certain countries may have raised questions about their commitment to human rights and religious freedom. However, it is important to approach these discussions with nuance and consider the diversity of perspectives within any given country. So what next? The report on religious freedom highlights concerns regarding the alleged meetings between diplomats and Tibetan refugees without proper communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal. This raises questions about the misuse of diplomatic privileges and the need for the ministry to assert its position in such matters. Nepal has a history of holding Indian and Chinese leaders accountable for their remarks in the past and demanding apologies when necessary. If Nepal does not take a firm stand in this situation, it may signal a perceived weakness in its foreign affairs and a deviation from its past stance on asserting its sovereignty and diplomatic rights.",political

"7 years on, ride-sharing services in Nepal continue to suffer absence of regulation","On March 26, the  Ministry of Home Affairs  issued a directive to all district administration offices to stop private vehicles from carrying passengers  The circular was issued at the request of transportation entrepreneurs.  Then the police began to crack down on ride-sharing services in Kathmandu. According to Asheem Man Singh Basnyat, the managing director of Pathao, a ride-sharing service, riders are still facing the question of the legality of the service on the road. In early 2023, the Kathmandu Valley Traffic Police Office fined riders providing mobility services using apps like  Pathao  and  InDrive  by charging fares. Traffic police informed in a press statement that 20 people were prosecuted for carrying passengers on vehicles registered as private. The Federation of Nepali National Transport Entrepreneurs had submitted a memorandum to the Ministry of Home Affairs demanding to stop carrying passengers on private vehicles as it is against the law. Section 12 of the  Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act, 1993 , has that a vehicle registered for one purpose cannot be used for another purpose. However, the federation says that private vehicles, in the name of ride-sharing services, are carrying passengers just like public transport. It has been over six and a half years since ride-sharing services have been introduced in Nepal. However, there is no law to regulate them yet which makes them vulnerable to police crackdown frequently. Amid the rising popularity of such services, the government never looks serious to  give them legal recognition or ban them completely .  Unsettled forever Tootle, a Nepali company began ride-sharing services on motorcycles and taxis in early 2017. It means it has already been six and a half years of its service. However, the  Department of Transport Management  says that it is illegal to collect fares and carry passengers on private vehicles From January 18, 2019, the traffic police started taking action against ride-sharing services at the request of the department. However, then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli directed them to stop the action on November 20, 2019, stating that innovation should be encouraged after the service users strongly protested the government’s move on social media. However, the department warned that vehicles registered for private purposes would be prosecuted, later. After that, a Pathao rider was fined by the traffic police. After protests from the public, the then Transport Minister Basanta Nembang interfered and stopped the action. On March 20, 2020, after the taxi entrepreneurs besieged the office against ride-sharing services, the Transport Management Department issued a notice at midnight and said again, “Those vehicles registered for various purposes other than public vehicles should not be used as public vehicles. Otherwise, action will be taken.” Again there was opposition to the government’s move. On March 12, 2020, the Patan High Court, hearing the petition filed by the Nepal Metre Taxi Association, gave an order not to stop the ride-sharing services immediately and to allow it to run by making the necessary laws. Even after that, the tendency of government agencies to issue notices to stop the ride-share services, arrest the riders and not work on the necessary law is still the same. As the passengers themselves raise their voices in favour of such services, there is a moral crisis for the government to ban them. Increasing safety concerns The government is indifferent to legalising ride-sharing services by amending the Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act, 1993. In recent times, private motorbikes have been rampant in carrying passengers without using ride-sharing apps, and the activity is known as offline rides. Such a practice has flourished due to the greed to earn a little more for the rider and save some money for the passengers. However, it is seen that this service can become a trap for both passengers and riders in terms of security. Riders get up to 20 per cent profit from offline ride-sharing services. Apart from the fact that the rider can be easily found, there is no benefit for the passengers. However, some passengers end up bargaining because the fare is a few rupees cheaper than online. Passengers are forced to go to crossroads in search of offline rides after not being able to take a ride when requested through the apps.  But offline rides have made security matters more complicated in the evening and at night than during the day. In offline rides, there is a risk for both the rider and the passenger. There is a high chance that their safety can be compromised. The risk of misbehaviour, abduction, robbery, and even terrible crimes has increased. Once, the  rider has also been abducted  and robbed. The regulation of ride-sharing services has been highlighted once again after a man using such a service was allegedly involved in the recent  Nira Pandey murder case in Kapan , Kathmandu.  Loss to the government Due to the non-regulation of ride-sharing services, the government is also losing the tax it could get. For example, once the services are legally recognised, the government could collect income tax from service providers.  Likewise, the Office of the Auditor General has drawn the attention of the government saying that even companies that are not registered in Nepal are evading taxes by providing passenger transportation services.  Public transport operators and taxi drivers have repeatedly attacked ride-sharing operators for taking away their passengers. Differences and disputes between public vehicles and riders are adding to the challenge. Ride sharers are also confused about the technical standards of motorcycles, the minimum standards to be followed while providing services, and insurance after an accident. It also makes ride-sharing service users unsafe. There is no government mechanism to resolve disputes between passengers and riders. There is no rule about the 24-hour customer care centre that the service provider must maintain. The police are also facing problems in tracing the criminal incidents of ride-sharing services. There is no rule about rent and commission. Extreme negligence by the government Yet, the government is unable to stop ride-sharing services due to their growing popularity. Nonetheless, it is hesitant to legalise the services as well.  In the Bill to Amend Some Nepal Acts, there are proposals such as  increasing the licence period  from five to 10 years in the Transport Management Act and allowing the private sector to check vehicle pollution. However, the issue of regulating the ride-sharing services, pending for six and a half years, has not been prioritised this time either.   Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN-Maoist Centre had announced in its manifesto for the November 2022 elections that it would give legal recognition to services such as Tootle, Pathao and InDrive. However, after coming to power, the Maoists have forgotten their election promises. According to Basnet, the managing director of Pathao, there might be a vested interest of certain groups behind the government’s failure to recognise ride-sharing services. “Earlier, we believed the government’s statement that it could not be done due to the pandemic,” he says, “Yet nothing has been done on the legal aspect yet.”  Many ride-sharing services such as Pathao are registered with the government. Initially, such companies, which were in dispute for not coming under the value-added tax (VAT), have now come under the scope of revenue. But these services are not regulated from the legal aspect of transportation management. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel says that the government’s style of not improving the public transport system and not giving legitimacy to the ride-sharing services preferred by the users is wrong. He says that if the services that have emerged through the use of technology are not addressed through the law, distortions and adverse effects cannot be seen in such services in the future. Gajurel says that the government’s tendency to settle disputes and then sit with its hands tied when there is a problem will not provide a long-term solution. “If the problem persists, there is a danger that this service will become ineffective, substandard and unsafe,” he says. Provincial governments’ failure Provincial governments are also failing to recognise ride-sharing services as the federal government. The Bagmati provincial government has made arrangements in its Transport Act to legalise Tootle and Pathao so that private vehicles can be operated as public vehicles by charging a specified fare in the specified area. According to the provincial government, this provision has been made because the management of transportation (four-wheeled and two-wheeled) is on the list of rights of the province in the schedule of the constitution. Published in the provincial gazette on February 1, 2019, the provision states, “Four-wheeled and two-wheeled vehicles with registration certificates for non-commercial purposes can transport passengers after completing the prescribed procedure and taking the prescribed fare on their route and carrying passenger insurance.” The provincial government had arranged for companies providing ride-sharing services to be registered by mid-April 2023. Through the Economic Bill, the government made a mandatory provision to register vehicles used for the purpose of renting vehicles with private numbers. However, this arrangement has also become confusing after transportation entrepreneurs raised questions. After the entrepreneurs said that the law of the province should not conflict with the federal law, the provincial government is also not convinced about the law of compulsory registration. Ishwari Datta Paneru, the spokesperson of the Department of Transport Management, says that ride-sharing services can be legalised only through provincial; laws. “Federalism was not envisioned in the current law, but according to the constitution and work detailing report, many transport-related services and regulations have been done by the provincial government,” he says, “Provinces can legalise ride-sharing services.” Asman Tamang, the secretary of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Transport of the Bagmati province, says, “We are discussing the draft of the procedure; many arrangements have to be made to organise ride sharing.”  Paneru, the spokesperson of the Department of Transport Management, says that in the draft of the new Federal Transport and Vehicle Act, an arrangement has been proposed to legalise ride-sharing services This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Supreme Court clears the decks for Bindabasini Kansakar to replace Dhaka Kumar Shrestha,"Kathmandu, May 25 The  Supreme Court  has denied continuing a previous interim order that stopped the Federal Parliament Secretariat to induct  Bindabasini Kansakar  as a House of Representatives member, replacing Dhaka Kumar Shrestha. A division bench of justices Kumar Regmi and Nahakul Subedi on Wednesday denied the continuity of the  order handed down by Justice Til Prasad Shrestha  on May 8.

The May 8 order had told Rastriya Swatantra Party not to remove its lawmaker Dhaka Kumar Shrestha from the party as well as the House of Representatives.

"Harka Sampang’s drive for drinking water in Dharan: By people, for people","At 6 am on a usual Saturday morning, a large number of people gather around an organic green tea shop at Dhankute Road, Dharan, creating traffic congestion.  Harka Sampang , the mayor of the  Dharan sub-metropolitan city  dressed in a tracksuit covered with dirt and dust, is seen with a microphone requesting them to clear the way for smooth traffic movement. These people are the volunteers who came to help the mayor by providing free labour for a cause, for clean drinking water in Dharan. With his command, vehicles loaded with food, water, and pipes leave for the site. At 8, Sampang leaves for the site and other vehicles like buses and motorcycles follow him. It looks like a kind of procession.    They stop at the Baghuwa stream and get divided into three groups. One group starts tying a rope to the pipe, and two people carry the pipe and climb uphill in the forest. After leaving the pipe there, they go down and climb up again carrying the pipe. Former British Gurkha Pasang Sherpa (70) says he did not even imagine that hundreds of people would come to build a system for drinking water in Dharan to bring water to Dharan in his lifetime. But now he himself is in that crowd, carrying pipes in the hot weather. Meanwhile, meals are being prepared on the banks of the stream for the workers. At around 12, volunteers have lunch. Then, some return home, and some go uphill to the forest to carry the pipes again. By 6 in the evening, those who are engaged in volunteering for drinking water in Dharan return home. Mayor Sampang returns at last. “He is the first to go and the last to return,” says Ashok Sharma, a member of his secretariat. After being elected last year, Harka Sampang has made drinking water in Dharan his number one priority. And, he is working on it by mobilising the people themselves to set an example of how democracy works. Weekly volunteering drive Sampang, who was elected as the mayor of Dharan in 2022, has run a volunteering campaign every Saturday for drinking water in Dharan. He calls Saturdays Dharan’s volunteers’ day. In his call, people volunteer, not only as individuals but also at the institutional level. Gym clubs, cooperatives, banks, and Gorkha recruitment centres in Dharan actively contribute to the campaign. Sanjita Rai (38), wearing a t-shirt showing the logo of the Bagarkot businessperson’s committee, says she had previously volunteered twice. “Right now, we have joined the campaign as a decision was made by our business committee to work voluntarily,” she says. Dharan’s drinking water dearth Nestled at the foot of the Mahabharata mountain range, Dharan has everything except water. Some 120 years ago, when Chandra Shamsher established the city, the situation was opposite to what it is now. Some 15 years after that, the water from the Turke stream reached Gomukhe Dhara. The springs around the Bijayapur hills would also supply drinking water in Dharan.  But, now, there is not enough water in the Turke. There are only pipes that remind the locals that once there was water, which used to reach the city. After the development of the eastern hill as a commercial centre, people settled at the foot of the hills where the water sources were located. Houses were built in places where there were water sources. “After the British government opened an office to recruit Gurkha soldiers in Dharan, the population here increased, the hustle and bustle also increased,” says Rajendra Sharma, a former associate professor of Mahendra Multiple Campus, “Then, gradually, drinking water in Dharan became a big problem.” To solve the problem, King Birendra Shah ordered the removal of the settlements around the Sardu reservoir. Those families were moved to Shanischare in Morang. In the late 1980s, Nepal Water Supply Corporation placed pipes from the Sardu watershed area and supplied water to the public taps in Dharan. But even this could not satisfy the thirst of the growing population. A drinking water project started in the early 2010s with the help of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to bring water from deep tube wells buried in the Charkose forest. But even this could not help the shortage of drinking water in Dharan. “If the ADB project had provided water as per the plan, we would not have been suffering from a water crisis,” says Ganesh Paudel, a local businessperson. According to Raju Pokharel, the executive director of the Dharan Water Supply Management Board, the board currently distributes around 20 million litres of water to the residents of Dharan every day, collected from deep tube wells and other sources. “However, Dharan needs 30 million litres of water daily,” he says. Due to a lack of supply as per the demand, people stand in line carrying water vessels for their turn to fill them on the scheduled water supply days. Surya Rai says, “I go to the Water Supply Board’s office for taking a bath and go to relatives for washing my clothes.” The rise of Harka Sampang As drinking water in Dharan is the main problem at hand, political parties have been using this as their election agenda. In the hope of quenching the thirst, the people of Dharan sometimes elected the UML and sometimes the Nepali Congress leaders as the mayor. But their suffering was not addressed. So, this time, they selected the independent candidate Sampang as their mayor. Sampang, who has been active in social campaigns in Dharan for a decade, wooed locals after protesting about corruption in the water supply project. Sampang started a water campaign as soon as he returned to Nepal from his six-year stay in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Sampang says people there do not suffer from drinking water shortages in the deserts like Iraq and Afghanistan, but here, locals always have to bear the brunt. “After that, I started a campaign to find out what was wrong with drinking water in Dharan.” After being elected the mayor, he swore that he would quench the thirst of Dharan no matter what. Right now, Sampang is working hard to fulfil that promise. Every time he goes to the forest to work for water, he wears a tracksuit that later gets covered with dust and mud. Budding hopes Harka Sampang has run a volunteer labour campaign without even taking a decision from the sub-metropolitan city. Even though he is the mayor, he is also criticised for not making a decision from the municipality and for starting the placement of pipes for drinking water in Dharan without following the process of environmental impact and feasibility studies. But in response to criticism, he asks, “Do you want water or paper?” However, he has brought the water from Pakuwa, Sardu, Nishane and Balukhola streams to Dharan with the help of volunteers. These rivers run out of water in the dry season and cannot fulfil the long-term need of the locals. Yet locals are hopeful. With the same hope, volunteer Pasang Sherpa says, “Harka Sampang did what the party leaders could not do for so many years.” Hundreds of people like him believe the problem of drinking water in Dharan will be solved with the strength of volunteerism and work every Saturday for free. Businesspersons have donated according to their capacity for the water campaign. Locals living abroad have also sent money. Every Saturday morning, people come to the organic green tea shop at Dhankuta Road to work and meet the mayor. Pavitra Rai (65) of Dharan-16 arrives there on Sunday morning. Recently, she also donated Rs 100,000 for drinking water in Dharan. “I can’t volunteer to work. So, I decided to give it to those who work,” she was heard saying while handing over the money, “If you can work, you can volunteer and if you can’t, you have to help in some way.” According to Dutt Kumar Limbu, who is managing the donations coming in this way, around Rs 90.5 million has been collected in cash and in kind. Rs 20 million have already been spent in efforts to bring water from the Kokah stream, which is the current site of work. It is estimated that another Rs 20 million will be required for the completion of the project. Funds are used to purchase supplies for the equipment and other supplies as well as for food and water for the volunteers committed to solving the problem of drinking water in Dharan. According to Ashok Rai, who is in the secretariat of Sampang, about 40 people have been employed for the project where each employee is paid a daily wage of Rs 1,100. They help in the technical aspect of the project. Mayor Sampang, desperate to solve the problem, says, “So many people come to donate, which has given financial support to the campaign as well as opened the obstacles on the path for drinking water in Dharan.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Nepal’s Ministry of Women fails to promote women’s leadership within–hence anywhere,"With Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal expanding his Council of Ministers for the tenth time recently, the leadership of the  Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens  has changed again. Succeeding Nepal Samajbadi Party leader Mahindra Raya Yadav, Nepali Congress leader  Surendra Raj Acharya was appointed  as the new minister. Yadav took charge of this ministry on March 31. But just after 33 days, he was transferred to the Ministry of Water Supply. Acharya is the fifth person to lead this ministry in the current government.  A day after being sworn in, starting December 26, 2022, PM himself took over the leadership of this ministry. He held the position for 23 days. And, on January 17, CPN-UML’s Bhagawati Chaudhary got the responsibility. But when the UML left the government on February 27, Dahal took over this ministry again, making him the third change in the leadership. After him, Yadav and now Acharya took over the leadership.  Five leadership changes in seven expansions of the cabinet, in such a short time, have only weakened the Ministry of Women. National Assembly member Kamala Pant says it is not good for a man to be a minister for the portfolio. She says, “Ministries that work for vulnerable groups such as women, children and senior citizens have not been given priority. They also get less budget. It has become a complimentary title, a way to satisfy all.” But this is not just about now, the ministry has been unstable for about three decades now, which experts believe is evidence of why the state bodies have failed to promote women’s leadership in Nepal.  28 years, 70 ministers This Ministry of Women was formed in 1995 when Sher Bahadur Deuba was the prime minister. Congress leader Pant says, “It was formed with the aim of advocating and strengthening the presence of women in government bodies, but it could not perform as intended.” The facts also support Pant’s statement. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens, when there are 70 ministers in total, the prime ministers have led this ministry 15 times. PM Dahal has led the ministry four times while other former prime ministers including Deuba headed the ministry four times, Girija Prasad Koirala three times, Surya Bahadur Thapa twice and Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai have led this ministry once each. Prime ministers leading any ministry indicate a delay in delegating portfolios during cabinet expansions. Lack of delegation makes the prime minister the de facto leader of any empty portfolio(s). If one looks at the 28 years of the ministry’s history, the number of ministers (including 51 ministers, 14 state ministers and five assistant ministers) has reached 70. That means one minister assumed office for five months on average. Ministry of Women without women’s leadership Another look at the  data says  that out of the 49 ministers at the Ministry of Women so far, only 13 were women. They were Lila Koirala, Sahana Pradhan, Ashtalakshmi Shakya, Durga Shrestha, Jaipuri Gharti Magar, Riddhi Baba Pradhan, Neelam KC, Asha Koirala, Tham Maya Thapa Magar, Juli Kumari Mahato, Chanda Chaudhary, Uma Regmi and Bhagawati Chaudhary,  The rest of the ministers were men. Women, however, are in the majority as state ministers. So far, 11 of the 14 state ministers have been women.  In total, there have been 24 women leaders as ministers, state and assistant ministers. This is 35 per cent of the total number of ministers at the Ministry of Women.  The number of women ministers in the current  cabinet  is also low. The 23-member Council of Ministers includes Rekha Sharma (Communications and Information Technology), Ranjita Shrestha (Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation) and Sita Gurung (Urban Development), Sushila Sripaili Thakuri (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation/State minister) and Nanda Chapai (Physical Infrastructure and Transport/State minister).  The three female ministers in this cabinet make up 13 per cent of the total ministers and add state ministers, it would be 20 per cent. Former minister Jaipuri Gharti Magar says that the fault behind the Ministry of Women’s poor presence and performance lies in the mindset of the leadership. “This ministry was supposed to be for women in leadership. But the ministry could not perform. And with no resources, means and power, it was bound to fail.” Magar adds, “It is not that only women should go to the Ministry of Women, but it is better for a woman to be in the leadership because they will work in the field of women.” “Men were being allotted in this ministry as well, which was meant for women’s leadership. But as their first choice was another ministry, many changed portfolios quicker,” adds Pant, the former state minister of this ministry.

Neocolonialism has cost both the Nepali economy and politics. What are the solutions?,"Neocolonialism is a term used to describe the economic and political influence that developed countries exert over developing countries, often through indirect means such as international trade, foreign investment and international aid. Nepal, a small landlocked country located in the Himalayas, has been subject to  neocolonialism  although it has not been a colony politically. Consequently, it is making significant negative impacts on the Nepali economy and politics. So it is about time the country thought of the solutions. Promoting inequality One of the most significant negative impacts of neocolonialism on the Nepali economy is the unequal distribution of resources and wealth. Developed countries often use their economic power to extract resources from developing countries at a low cost, leaving little for local populations. This has been the case in Nepal, where multinational corporations have been granted access to the country’s natural resources, such as timber and minerals, at a low cost. This has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, environmental degradation, and a loss of revenue for the Nepali government. Furthermore, neocolonialism has led to the exploitation of Nepali labour. Many  multinational corporations  have established factories in Nepal, taking advantage of cheap labour and relaxed labour laws. These corporations often pay low wages and provide poor working conditions, leading to the exploitation of workers. This has resulted in a decline in the standard of living for many Nepali citizens. In addition to the impacts on the Nepali economy, neocolonialism has also had a negative impact on Nepal’s political system. Developed countries often use their economic power to influence the political decisions of developing countries. In Nepal, this has resulted in a lack of political autonomy, with decisions often being made to appease foreign governments and corporations rather than to benefit the Nepali people. This has led to corruption, a lack of transparency and a weakening of democratic institutions. Moreover, the  influence of foreign powers in Nepal’s political system  has resulted in a lack of investment in key areas such as education, healthcare and infrastructure. Developed countries often prioritise investments that benefit their own economies, not the Nepali economy. This has resulted in a lack of investment in critical areas, leaving Nepal’s citizens without access to basic services. Impacts on Nepali economy and politics in detail Neocolonialism can inflict significant trauma on the Nepali economy and politics. They have been explained below: Potential solutions So, to eradicate the effect of neocolonialism on the Nepali economy and politics, Nepal should follow the following measures: • : Nepal’s economy heavily relies on agriculture, tourism, and remittances, making it vulnerable to the external shocks of neocolonialism. Diversifying the economy by investing in new industries, such as technology and manufacturing, could reduce the country’s dependence on these sectors and strengthen its economic independence. •  : Nepal could work to promote fair trade practices that prioritise the needs of local businesses and communities over foreign corporations. This could involve developing policies that protect local producers and workers from exploitation and support the growth of domestic industries and the Nepali economy, overall. •  : Education is a powerful tool for reducing neocolonialism’s effects by empowering citizens with knowledge and skills to participate actively in their country’s economic and political systems. Nepal could invest in education by increasing access to schools, improving the quality of education, and supporting vocational training programmes that equip young people with relevant skills. •  : Strengthening democratic institutions is an essential step in reducing neocolonialism’s effects on Nepal’s politics. This could involve promoting transparency and accountability in government, increasing civic participation, and supporting the development of independent media that can hold the government accountable. •  : Nepal could work to build stronger regional cooperation with neighbouring countries, such as India and China, to reduce its dependence on Western powers on the Nepali economy and politics and increase its bargaining power in international negotiations. This could involve collaborating on infrastructure projects, trade agreements, and cultural exchanges that promote mutual understanding and respect. Overall, reducing the effects of neocolonialism on the Nepali economy and politics will require sustained efforts across multiple fronts. By diversifying the economy, promoting fair trade practices, investing in education, strengthening political institutions, and building regional cooperation, Nepal can take steps towards greater economic and political independence.",political

Can protests free the judiciary in Nepal of corruption and political influence?,"Protests have long been used as a tool to demand change and hold those in power accountable. However, when it comes to erasing corruption and political influence in the judiciary in Nepal, the power of protests is not so visible.  While protests have the potential to raise public awareness and pressure authorities to address judicial corruption, these issues are deeply ingrained and difficult to eliminate. Recently, the Nepal Bar Association staged a protest against the  delay in the appointment of the chief justice . Meanwhile, the judiciary in Nepal also faces protests, mainly from the  Nepal Bar Association , on recurring issues such as corruption and political influences. But have they made any impact yet?  The power of protests Throughout history, protests have brought about significant social and political change. From the civil rights movement in the United States to the Arab Spring in the Middle East, protests have been a powerful force for promoting democracy, human rights, and social justice. In the context of judicial corruption and political influence, protests can raise public awareness about these issues and put pressure on authorities to take action. This pressure can be particularly effective when it is sustained and backed by a broad coalition of civil society groups and other stakeholders.  In 2015, a massive earthquake struck Nepal, causing widespread devastation and exposing widespread corruption in the distribution of relief funds. Civil society groups organised protests and public campaigns calling for an independent investigation into corruption and for the judiciary in Nepal to hold those responsible accountable. As a result of these protests, the Supreme Court ordered the government to investigate and punish those responsible for the corruption.  In 2020, Nepali civil society groups organised protests and public campaigns calling for judicial reform and accountability, and for the establishment of an independent judicial commission to oversee the appointment, promotion, and disciplinary action of judges. The protests led to the formation of a judicial commission, which has the power to investigate and discipline judges accused of misconduct or corruption. There are more successful examples of protests reforming the judiciary in Nepal.  Challenges of erasing judicial corruption Despite the potential of protests to raise awareness and pressure authorities to address judicial corruption, erasing this problem is much easier said than done.  Corruption and political influence are deeply ingrained and systemic issues in the judiciary in Nepal that require more than just public pressure to eliminate. In many cases, they are the result of a lack of judicial independence, a weak legal framework, and a culture of impunity that allows those in power to act with impunity. Addressing these issues requires more than just protest movements, but also legal reforms, institutional changes, and strengthening the independence and accountability of the judiciary.  A major way to erase corruption from the judiciary in Nepal is to make the appointment process of constitutional organs free of political influence. To combat judicial corruption, countries also need to take specific steps such as strengthening judicial independence, improving transparency and accountability, building public trust, and implementing anti-corruption measures such as codes of conduct and whistleblower protections. The impact of protests on judicial reform While protests have the potential to put pressure on authorities to address corruption and political influence in the judiciary in Nepal, their effectiveness is not guaranteed. The success of protest movements depends on a range of factors, including the level of public support, the strength of civil society organisations, the ability to leverage media attention, and the willingness of authorities to listen to the demands of protesters.  In some cases, protests have been successful in promoting judicial reform and accountability, as in the case of Brazil’s Car Wash investigation. In other cases, protests have failed to bring about change or even resulted in a backlash against activists and civil society groups. Protests do not guarantee that it is always possible to reform the system, yet they can be a part of a bigger reform process which also includes the role of media and other stakeholders.  Yet, the action taken by the Nepal Bar Association is perfect now as it creates pressure for the government to make a  decision about the appointment of the chief justice , the head of the judiciary in Nepal, faster. The role of international organisations and media In addition to protests, international organisations and media coverage can play a role in promoting independence and combatting corruption in the judiciary in Nepal. International organisations can provide technical assistance and promote best practices while media coverage can raise awareness and put pressure on authorities to take action.  Media coverage can bring attention to corrupt practices within the judiciary and help to expose cases of judicial misconduct and corruption. Investigative journalism can also help uncover systemic issues and hold those responsible accountable. For example, in Brazil, Operation Car Wash was a media-led investigation into corruption at the highest levels of government and business, which resulted in the prosecution of numerous politicians and businesspeople.  International organisations such as the United Nations and the World Bank can provide support and guidance to countries seeking to combat judicial corruption. They can provide technical assistance, training and best practices to help countries strengthen their judicial systems and root out corrupt practices. For example, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has developed tools and guidance to help countries prevent and address judicial corruption. In conclusion, the potential impact of protests on corruption and political influence in the judiciary in Nepal is complex and multifaceted. While they can be a powerful tool for raising public awareness and putting pressure on authorities, they are not a panacea for erasing these systemic issues. To truly address these problems, legal reforms, institutional changes, and strengthening the independence and accountability of the judiciary are necessary.",political
New bill registered in parliament to free Resham Chaudhary,"Kathmandu, May 11 The government has introduced a new bill with the aim of releasing former lawmaker Resham Chaudhary,  serving life imprisonment  for his involvement in the 2015 Tikapur incident.

5 things that shaped the development of law in Nepal,"Nepal marks  National Law Day  on Baishakh 26 every year as per the Nepali calendar to commemorate the issuance of the law to govern Nepal’s judicial system in 2009 BS (May 8, 1952), considering it as a milestone in the development of law in Nepal. Different law-related organisations all over the country are celebrating the day in various ways.  Law is something that binds people under the rules and regulations. A country without the law is unimaginable. In modern society, the law has been a part of human life as they say  ignorance of the law  is no excuse.  So, on the occasion of National Law Day, let’s review the development of law in Nepal so far.  Talking about Nepal’s legal system, it has a long history and in all these years, it has witnessed changes galore. Here are some of the major changes that have shaped the development of law in Nepal’s history.  1. The inception of the legal system in Nepal The  history  of the development of law in Nepal dates back to over 2,000 years ago. The formal discussion on the legal system began during the  Kirant dynasty  (early 307 BC), the first ruling dynasty of Nepal.  During that time, there were four tribunals: Kuther, Sulli, Ligwal and Mapchok. Back then, the primary source of law was Mundum, the religious scripture of Kirant. Mainly, in Mundum, there were rules regarding birth, death, marriage and property.  Likewise, theft, robbery and murder were considered crimes. During this period inter-caste marriage was unacceptable. The king used to be the ultimate body to provide justice to the public. The king used to appoint specific people to formulate laws.  2. Systemisation of judicial administration  Despite spending most of the time in unification, King  Prithivi Narayan Shah  also made a notable contribution to the development of law in Nepal. The judicial administration of the country became systematic during his reign. A kachahari (court) was set up in each district, which used to be operated by officials with the titles of Dittha, Bichari and Pandit. They worked together with the district administrator, called amali, to adjudicate cases. With that, Shah also abolished almost all previous courts and established many courts. It is  found  that the law back then was based on  Yajnavalkya Smriti , a Hindu religious text.  3. Making of Muluki Ain  The Rana regime is also a significant phase in the development of Nepal’s legal system.  In 1853, the first Muluki Ain, also known as the first written law of the country, was  formulated  under the reign of Surendra Bikram Shah. It codified all laws of Nepal – civil and criminal, including religious and customary. The Muluki Ain, perhaps one of the greatest milestones in the development of law in Nepal, exempted Brahmins and women from capital punishment; instead, they were subject to “damal”, life imprisonment with confiscation of property and other legal consequences, upon conviction of capital crimes.  4. Independent judiciary  Late kings, Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah Dev and Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, made remarkable contributions to the development of law in Nepal. King Tribhuvan introduced laws that made the judiciary independent and established the Pradhan Nayalaya (the Supreme Court) as the highest and final court of the land. He later revised this by commanding that the highest court should revise its own decisions according to law, as and when necessary, under established procedures. Extensive legal and judicial reforms were, however, carried out during the reign of King Mahendra, which significantly impacted Nepal’s legal system. He was the first Nepali monarch to introduce a constitution as the fundamental law of the nation. Under his reign, the previous Muluki Ain was replaced with a new one that emphasised the principle of equality before the law and abolished the consideration of caste and religion in practising law.   5. Constitution by numbers  So far Nepal has  seven constitutions , which are considered the laws of all other laws. They are the Government of Nepal Act issued in 1948, the Interim Government of Nepal Act issued in 1951, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal issued in 1959, the Constitution of Nepal issued in 1962, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal issued in 1990, the Interim Constitution of Nepal issued in 2007 and the Constitution of Nepal issued in 2015.  On September 20, 2015, an elected Constituent Assembly promulgated the latest constitution of Nepal, which remains in effect to this day.",political
Dhaka Kumar Shrestha audio scandal: Supreme Court tells party not to remove him now,"Kathmandu, May 8 The  Supreme Court  has issued an interim order in the name of the Rastriya Swatantra Party to not remove its lawmaker Dhaka Kumar Shrestha from the party as well as the House of Representatives. A single bench of Justice Til Prasad Shrestha on Monday issued the order in response to the writ petition filed by lawmaker Shrestha, arguing the party took action against him without following due procedures. The bench also summoned both sides of the case for the next hearing.  Last month, the  party announced  it removed lawmaker Dhaka Kumar Shrestha from the party. It has also already written to the parliament about the action taken against him. Shrestha was drawn into controversy after an audiotape in which he reportedly asked Rs 20 million from controversial businessperson Durga Prasai claiming he would be soon appointed the health minister leaked. Whereas Shrestha at first denied that it was his audio, he later said the audio was leaked. Organising a press conference this afternoon, Shrestha said the act of leaking the audiotape from January was a conspiracy against the party. He had said he would file a case against the decision at the court and come back with a clean chit.",political
"Tukucha uncovering: Court says river should be conserved, but private property should be protected too","Kathmandu, May 8 Giving an end to the months-long dispute that whether the Tukucha in Kathmandu is a natural river or just a passage of sewage, the  Patan High Court  says it is a river and a tributary of the Bagmati and hence should be conserved. However, the court also rules that the river shares its area with private property owned by locals in the capital, whose property rights should be protected by the state authorities. Hearing a petition filed by Bishwa Prakash Sakha of Kathmandu metropolitan city-1, a division bench of judges Mahesh Sharma Paudyal and Rajyalaxmi Bajracharya handed down its final verdict on February 1, 2023. But its full text was released just recently.  Earlier, the court had  issued an interim order , barring the Kathmandu city government from continuing its  Tukucha uncovering campaign , interpreting the city government’s drive as an interference in the fundamental rights of the locals. But, with the full text published, the local government will now resume the campaign, says Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah in a  Facebook post .",political
Digital data loss is troubling Nepal in front of the helpless government,"In March, various government servers at the  National Information Technology Centre  (NITC) experienced issues one after another. Initially reported as a simple technical problem, the NITC later reported that it lost data from various government agencies. Stating that digital data loss was due to technical reasons, the NITC has not been able to find out how many details they lost and how. The NITC’s list of responsibilities is long. It has been tasked with the responsibility of storing, managing and processing government data along with ensuring its safety. It also needs to provide shared computing resources, consult the government on various IT-related issues, register government domains and manage government networks. At the same time, the NITC–which helps the government in training officials, collocation of services, virtualisation, cloud services, web hosting and software development–has termed the latest incident as a machinery problem.  Pradip Paudel, the NTNC executive director, says that there was a problem in some parts of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of a server, leading to digital data loss, and efforts are being made to recover the data with global support. But the employees of the centre say they do not know how many government bodies have been affected by the digital data lass loss incident. They say they will only know when the concerned government bodies will inform them about their data being lost. Helpless government An official says it has been confirmed that many local level data including that of the Public Service Commission, Department of Health Service and Gorkhapatra have been lost. However, it is not clear which details of which agencies were deleted. Paudel claims that the data of about 10-15 agencies were lost. However, he cannot reveal the exact number. It is not certain whether the lost information will be recovered. The centre claims it has been trying to recover lost data with help from a foreign expert for over a month. The NITC says efforts are being made to recover the data with the help of Oracle International, but sources say it is almost impossible to solve the problem. “Experts have said that this kind of digital data loss is something that has not happened in the world,” says one of the technicians at the centre. “We will try for one more week to recover data, but things do not look likely.” This has started to affect the performance of various government agencies. According to the Public Service Commission, data about more than 85,000 examinees preparing for the various examinations are missing. This has resulted in the commission postponing the exams by three weeks; it has asked applicants to fill out the form again. Toya Narayan Subedi, the spokesperson of the commission, says that the data of those who filled out the online form for the exams between November 2022 and March 2023 have been lost. The commission is facing issues as it does not even have data on people who have paid the examination fees and has asked those who applied to submit their vouchers when submitting the form. “Because all the details were lost, it took time for us to identify the examinees,” says Subedi. ”The details of applicants who paid are at the Office of the Comptroller General and we are using that to identify who has paid and who hasn’t.” Another employee of the commission says that the exams, scheduled to begin on May 27, will have to be postponed for at least a month or two as it needs to carry out various preparations. “Although the efforts are ongoing, the commission has not received information about when the data will be recovered from the NITC. The commission is working on an alternative plan to conduct the examinations of pre-published advertisements,” read a statement issued by the commission. According to the Public Service Commission, since 2012, all the details have been kept in the NITC data centre at Singhadarbar. Now with the digital data loss, the commission does not know what to do and is looking at alternative options. Whose fault? Narayan Neupane, an information technology expert working in the field of data storage and management, says both NITC and the commission are at fault for the recent case of digital data loss. “The NITC should have kept a backup,” he says. “Even the technicians of the commissions should have made a clear policy regarding the need to back up its data.” The latest incident is proof of how weak the technical capacity of the NITC is and how that has  compromised the data security in the country . Officials of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology say that if the data centre took the issue of  government servers going down on January 28  seriously, this particular issue of digital data loss could have been dealt with differently. However, they believe since the data centre is operated in a sloppy manner, it faces regular problems. Systems handled by the NITC face regular issues. The servers go down frequently as does the internet while the websites are either down or operate very slowly. The recent case of the government’s digital data loss is clear that the centre is losing its credibility. Experts say a suitable mechanism for multilateral analysis and resolution of data security has not been created at the centre. Because of this, the report of the Office of the Auditor General in 2022 pointed out that the risk of cyber threats such as piracy, hacking, viruses, phishing, and malware was increasing. Paudel of the NITC says not all data are backed up. “Digital data loss is not only our concern; it is also the responsibility of those whose data have been lost,” says Paudel. “All we do is provide servers and resources. It is not just up to us to protect these data.” He says that another server has been given to the agencies including the Public Service Commission, and adds these agencies should also be responsible for protecting their own data. The storage network established in 2011 is now called Government Integrated Data Centre (GIDC). There is also a Disaster Recovery Centre which has been operating since May 14, 2019, in Hetauda, Makawanpur, so that all data is not destroyed if there is a problem. But Paudel says even the Disaster Recovery Centre does not back up all data. “If they write to us asking us to back up their data, we do so; otherwise we don’t,” says Paudel. Mismanagement galore The NITC does not keep records of the equipment at offices and agencies it is providing its services. It does not even analyse how much the capacity of the server is and how much the capacity should be in that server according to the customer pressure. It does not even regularly update the software and hardware it has purchased, which is also a major concern responsible for digital data loss, say officials. The information technology audit conducted by the Office of the Auditor General has pointed out the state of negligence at the centre.  According to the report, the centre does not have the details of the number agency it provided colocation services to. Internal system audits and regular technical audits of the data centre have not been done regularly either. The quality testing and levelling of organisations such as data centres, which store very important and confidential information of all government agencies and provide essential services, have not even been done. The centre has not made arrangements for multilateral and multi-level data security to meet international security standards either. Information technology expert Manohar Bhattarai says that the centre is operating without a reliable data security and access policy. “There are international standards, practices and accreditations for data centre operations. If there are risks when following all of it, imagine what can happen if you don’t follow it?” he questions. It is recognised that server security should be guaranteed by conducting national or internationally recognised tests such as an ISO 27001 certificate. For that, the centre has not shown interest in conducting regular internal and external tests. Cyber and physical security risks at the data centre have not been detected by the NITC due to a lack of technical testing by external agencies.  Data protection has not been done according to international standards in infrastructure quality, environment, security, access or disaster management. Most of the human resources employed at the data centre are temporary. Many do not have specific qualifications, skills, and expertise. Sources say the centre does not have staff that are knowledgeable about networking, database, cooling, power and other infrastructure.  Most of the work is put on computer engineers and whenever there are problems, it is forced to seek services from external parties. Bhattarai sees the government slipping in terms of IT infrastructure management and security despite regular digital data loss. “Data security can only be achieved if there is a combination of appropriate laws, organisational structure, technology and its management,” he says.  “In the changing times, the protection of the country’s borders should not be the only concern when it comes to national security,” he says. “Since there is so much dependence on technology, including the financial sector, the security of the data held by the government is also an equally important issue.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Should Nepal care about King Charles III’s coronation? Here are 6 historical facts to help you,"The  coronation of British King Charles III  is scheduled to be held this Saturday at Westminster Abbey. Charles acceded to the throne in September 2022 after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Dignitaries from several countries will be attending the much-awaited event of the British royal family on Saturday.  Nepal  has sent its foreign minister Narayan Prakash Saud  will be participating in the ceremony on behalf of President Ram Chandra Paudel, who is currently recovering from health issues. But should Nepal care about this big event? The Kingdom of Great Britain (the United Kingdom) and Nepal have been friendly allies for nearly two centuries now. The UK is one of the top development partners of Nepal. Tourism, trade, health, education and the British Gurkha remain the key dimensions of bilateral relations between these two countries.  Overall, the British royal family has very close ties with Nepal. Some of the significant areas of this connection are explained below. 1. Diplomatic relationships and treaties signed  The United Kingdom is the first ever nation in the world with which Nepal has had strong diplomatic relations for years.  On March 4, 1816, the  treaty of Sugauli  was signed between the East India Company and the Kingdom of Nepal, which further established intrinsic trade relations between Nepal and Britain and the British royal family. Later in 1923, Nepal and Britain signed a treaty of friendship that recognised Nepal as an independent and sovereign nation. The treaty also mentioned that both countries would maintain peace and mutual friendship.  Moreover, the United Kingdom ruled by the British royal family is also the first country in the world to establish its embassy in Kathmandu. And Nepal established its first diplomatic legation in London in 1934, which was Nepal’s first diplomatic mission, it was further elevated to the ambassador level in 1947.  2. Prince Charles III’s Nepal visit The new King Charles III, as the prince, along with several other dignitaries participated in the coronation ceremony of  King Birendra  in 1975. Later, in 1980, he  paid another official visit  to Nepal. According to a  BBC report , Prince Charles III was in Nepal again in 1998, during which he visited  Maiti Nepal , a leading NGO taking care of human trafficking survivors. The NGO founder Anuradha Koirala has told BBC that the prince later sent GBP 78,000 by selling his paintings, highlighting the British royal family is closely connected to Nepal.  3. Dual visits by Queen Elizabeth II Queen Elizabeth II  along with Prince Phillip visited Nepal in 1961 shortly after King Mahendra’s coup, in which he dissolved Nepal’s first-ever democratically elected parliament and ruled as a monarch. During the high-profile visit of British royal family members, the queen mostly paid homage to all the British Gurkha veterans who served in World War I and II.   In 1986, Queen Elizabeth II interacted with 200  British Gurkha soldiers,  amongst them were seven surviving soldiers who had been awarded the Victoria Cross. The monarch also expressed immense gratitude during her reign for the services provided by the British Gurkhas, making Nepal close to the British royal family.  4. Other remarkable royal visits Nepal’s Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana visited the British royal family in 1850. He was the first prime minister of Nepal to visit Great Britain. During his trip, he met Queen Victoria at St James’s Palace and even received the guard of honour.  Several kings and princes from the British royal family visited Nepal to indulge themselves in hunting. In December 1911,  King George V  took part in a hunt that was organised by the prime minister of Nepal. Such hunting trips were organised in order to strengthen the relationships between the two countries. Princess Diana of Wales,  another key member of the British royal family then, paid an official visit to Nepal in March 1993, as a patron of the British Red Cross Youth and Leprosy Mission. The princess showed concern and support for the unprivileged ones and interacted with them during her visit. 5. Most recent visit As per public knowledge, Prince Harry is the most recent  British royal family member to have visited Nepal . Prince Harry visited Nepal in 2016, a year after the massive earthquake. He paid tribute to all the survivors of the terrible disaster and even appreciated the resilience shown by Nepali people during such difficult times. He also visited the UNESCO cultural sites destroyed by the earthquake and expressed immense gratitude towards the Gurkhas and praised their bravery and commitment over the past 200 years. 6. The Gurkha guards’ contribution As one of the greatest allies of Britain, Nepali soldiers fought valiantly in both world wars and sacrificed their lives on several battlefields of the world. Thus, this has enhanced the deep heritage and friendship between Nepal and Great Britain as well as the British royal family. In fact, recruitment of the Gurkha soldiers in the British Army began in 1815 and continues to date. More remarkably, Prince Charles III himself took over the role of the colonel chief of the royal Gurkha rifles in 1977. Then, Queen Elizabeth II attended a parade in 2015  in London to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Gurkha service in the British Army. A royal Gurkha regiment contingent was invited to take part in the wedding ceremony of  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  in 2018.  Overall, although Nepal is no longer a monarchy and became a democratic republic on May 28, 2008, the British royal family is still closely linked with Nepal as it was for the past two centuries. Both countries are making efforts together to enhance their friendship and to provide assistance to each other in further development.",political

Fake Bhutanese refugee case and high-profile politicians and officials’ involvement explained,"Many Nepali politicians and bureaucrats are in a pickle at the moment. Police investigations found aides of major political leaders along with home secretaries have helped a gang rack up millions of rupees by sending Nepalis to the United States by claiming them as Bhutanese refugees. Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office  on March 26 arrested Keshav Dulal, Sanu Bhandari and Tek Gurung for sending Nepalis to the US by claiming they were Bhutanese refugees. Three days later, the police also arrested Sagar Rai. Based on their statements, the  police arrested Indrajit Rai , security advisor to former home minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, and former home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey. They also arrested former energy minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi’s son  Sandeep Rayamajhi for his role  in sending Nepalis abroad with fake documents. Officials involved in the investigation of the fake Bhutanese refugee documentation case say that Pandey was found to have racked in millions by helping a gang send people to the US. According to the police, Pandey got into this trade through Dulal and Bhandari. Dulal was Sujata Koirala’s personal assistant during her time as the country’s foreign minister. Since the fake Bhutanese refugee document case has involved high-profile names, it has been the talk of the town. But what is this case all about? How did the police find out about the involvement of such high-profile people? And who else is involved? Onlinekhabar answers all these questions in this explainer about the fake Bhutanese refugee case. What is the case of fake Bhutanese refugees? In 1990, people who fled from Bhutan entered Nepal through India and settled in Jhapa and Morang. According to government data, before they were relocated to another country, the number of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal was roughly 120,000. By 2018, as many as 113,307 people had resettled in a third country. Now, 6,577 people registered as Bhutanese refugees are still in refugee camps in Nepal. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Damak, which had been assisting refugees, has shut down since 2020. The  World Food Programme  (WFP), which has been providing cash and food support since December 30, 2018, has also stopped providing cash and food support. However, in the meantime, the government led by KP Sharma Oli on July 14, 2019, decided to form a task force under the coordination of Bal Krishna Panthi, the then joint secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, to study and gather more evidence about those who were left out of the refugee registration process due to various reasons. After the formation of the task force, the members of a gang in Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, Dang, Gorkha, Baglung and other districts started taking money from Nepalis stating they would send them to the US by registering them as fake Bhutanese refugees.  The report of the task force has not been made public to date. However, it has been found that the gang has collected Rs 1 million to Rs 4 million from Nepalis promising them they would be classified as refugees, which would make it easier for them to go to the US. How did this come out? According to a UML leader in Jhapa, the members of the gang involved in preparing fake Bhutanese refugee documents became active after the formation of the task force under the leadership of Panthi.  Sagar Rai, who was arrested by the police, was the ward chair of Pathari Shanishchare-10. During the investigation, the police discovered that Rai was looking for people willing to pay money to get to the US as fake Bhutanese refugees. “We have found they were looking for people willing to pay money to them for this. It was not just in Morang but in different places,” says Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office chief Manoj KC. “We have received complaints from 145 people.” According to the police, these people handed between Rs 1-5 million to the members of the gang. Some of them have told the police that they even sold their houses and paid the money to fulfil their American dream. Despite repeated assurances, they did not get their refugee identity cards. Neither were they informed about the process itself.  According to the police, after the gang felt pressure from the victims, the gang members started to add names to the report that was being prepared by Panthi and started to distribute copies of it to the victims for their assurance. “The report that has not been made public yet was in their access. There were two annexes added where names of missing refugees were added,” says an official involved in the fake Bhutanese refugee case investigation.  Police investigations have found names of Nepalis were added to the report in cahoots with the Home Ministry. According to the sources, in the initial report prepared by the Panthi-led task force, it was recommended the Home Ministry give identity cards to 429 people who missed the verification. However, according to police sources, the Ram Bahadur Thapa-led Home Ministry had written to the district administration offices of Jhapa and Morang asking for re-verification. “The ministry told the chief district officers to re-verify the number of refugees. As a result, the number has changed time and again,” says an official involved in the investigation. Following that, the fake Bhutanese refugees were shown their names on the refugee list. But the process to leave Nepal did not start, and they were worried and irked.  Why was it in limbo for these long years? As the process to send them to the US did not start soon, the fake Bhutanese refugees came to know that they were cheated.  Then some of them filed complaints at the  Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority  in November 2021. But their complaint was not registered.  This is when the people went to Kathmandu District Police Range, but it also did not investigate the case. The victims tried again and moved to the Valley Crime Investigation Office in March 2022. The office registered the complaint.  The complaint stated how Niraj Rai and his father Indrajit Rai, Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa’s advisor, along with other aides had taken Rs 56 million from various people claiming to send them to the US making them fake Bhutanese refugees. Basant Bahadur Kunwar, the current IGP, was the chief of the Valley Crime Investigation Office and with his promotion pending, he did nothing as the investigation was kept in limbo. Even when Nepali Congress leader Bal Krishna Khand was the home minister, the investigation did not proceed. Instead, it has been revealed that the then Home Secretary Tek Narayan Pandey was working with the gang. “The investigation had started then and now we are just filing a case against the accused,” says KC. However, according to the experts, the investigation of this case gained momentum after the home secretary Pandey was transferred. “There was an instruction from the home minister to investigate this case seriously and things moved forward quickly,” says an official investigating the case. Now, the District Police Range has started to investigate the case as an organised crime. How many people were made fake Bhutanese refugees? As of now, 20 complaints have been registered at the Valley Crime Investigation Office claiming they were defrauded of money with the promises of making them fake Bhutanese refugees. According to the office chief, Manoj KC, since there are many complainants in one complaint, the total number of victims is 145. The police also recovered fake Bhutanese refugee cards handed to them by the gang. Officials say that fake identity cards were distributed in cahoots with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The police also examined the report initially drafted by Panthi but tampered with by the people issuing fake Bhutanese refugee documents.  “A fake annexe was added to the report and given to the victims,” says an officer involved in the investigation. Who is the mastermind? How did the Home Ministry get involved? On March 26, the Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested Keshav Dulal, Sanu Bhandari and Tek Gurung on the charges of fraud. Three days later, Sagar Rai of Morang was also arrested. Officials involved in the investigation say that Dulal and Bhandari, a businessman from Lalitpur, worked to set up arrangements with the home administration and political leadership. When the task force was formed, Dulal and Bhandari convinced Pratik Thapa, the son of the then Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, his security advisor Indrajit Rai and his son Niraj, then energy minister and current UML Secretary Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and his son Sandeep to be a part of this plan. In the statement given by Dulal and Bhandari, it is mentioned that they have given around Rs 5.6 million to Indrajit Rai and his son Niraj for fake Bhutanese refugee documents. Will other politicians and bureaucrats be dragged into this? Ram Bahadur Thapa was the home minister when the Panthi-led task force was formed. At that time, his security advisor Indrajit Rai Rai, his son Pratik Thapa and others have been found to have helped the gang that collected over Rs 56 million from people claiming to send them to the US. The Panthi-led task force submitted its report to the then Home Secretary Prem Kumar Rai who was in office from April 9, 2018, to February 3, 2020.  The victims told the police Prem Kumar Rai, the current CIAA chief, is also involved in the fake Bhutanese refugee case. After him, Maheshwar Neupane was the home secretary from February 4, 2020, to August 11, 2021. After the government changed, Nepali Congress leader Bal Krishna Khand became the home minister and he replace Neupane with Tek Narayan Pandey. This is when Keshav Dulal and his gang started to get in contact with Pandey and put forward their idea to send people to the US by making them fake Bhutanese refugees taking a significant sum of money. Not only that, it has also been found that Pandey was paid a large sum by the group. While Pandey was cahooting with Dulal and his gang, victims were coming to meet him seeking justice. According to the police officers, it has been revealed that a cheque of Rs 10 million was issued in the name of Top Bahadur Rayamajhi’s son Sandeep.

Why does Nepal need ministers with professional backgrounds?,"In Nepal, political parties and their leaders mainly select their representatives for ministerial roles based on criteria such as their experiences with party association, subjective preferences of the party chairperson, political work, rotation policy, calculations for government alliances, balancing inner-party groups, and also preferring someone who has provided funding to the party for elections, but not professional backgrounds. In other words, criteria for selecting someone as a minister have been mostly limited to political reasons and justifications, dynamics within and among political parties, government alliances, or references and preferences of political leaders, without much consideration for professionalism. Does it mean that Nepal does not need ministers with professional backgrounds? Global practices and rational thoughts show otherwise. Learning from neighbours Of late, selecting someone as a minister based on his or her professional background has become rather popular in South Asia.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi  in India has given ample space to ex-bureaucrats, doctors, lawyers, managers and engineers over full-time politicians and party workers in his council of ministers. Similarly, the Chinese Communist Party has shifted from the era of Mao, when the political work of party members was given priority when it came to giving access to power in Chinese politics. These days, apart from political work, educational merit, a professorship and relevant professional background are considered essential components for the ministerial role in China. In Nepal too, the new political parties can distinguish themselves from conventional parties whenever the opportunity comes by giving ministerial roles to people with relevant professional backgrounds as representatives in their parties. For example, the  Rastriya Swatantra Party  has loaded itself with members and representatives who are professionals, business people with years of experience, entrepreneurs, technocrats who have worked for international agencies, former bureaucrats, lawyers, doctors, and engineers. Recently, internationally renowned economist  Swarnim Wagle has been elected  as a House of Representatives member from the party, which has sparked hope.  When we are discussing ministers with professional backgrounds, it does not mean someone who has a graduate or post-graduate degree; rather, it signifies someone who has a certain level of expertise, skill, sufficient institutional experience, or systemic operations and procedural knowledge in a particular field or occupation, or who has earned a living by engaging in the profession that is related to his or her assigned ministry. An example of a minister with professional background would be someone like  S Jaishankar,  who for many years was a diplomat in the Indian Foreign Service before turning into a politician and taking an assignment as the minister of external affairs in 2019. He not only holds a PhD in international relations from Jawaharlal Nehru University but as India’s foreign secretary, he also played a critical role in shaping India’s foreign policy. Hence, in terms of education, professional experience, institutional work, and expertise, he is a suitable person to serve as the minister of external affairs. Perks of professionalism When it comes to selecting ministers, it is necessary for political parties and their leaders to recognise the selection of people with relevant professional backgrounds such as work experience and education. Along with it, their institutional engagements are more essential and vital for some ministries as compared to others.  In ministries that only focus on governmental, community, activity-related, and socio-political issues, political work and involvement in grassroots politics can be both relevant and sufficient criteria for selecting someone as a minister.  We also need representatives with relevant political activism, ethical commitment, a moral stance, and ground-level networks and involvement as ministers. However, in ministries like industry, energy, foreign affairs, finance, communications technology, labour, and education, professionalism must be considered a necessary criterion for selecting someone as a minister.  After all, a minister who wants to provide effective and outcome-based leadership needs to understand the system, concepts, procedures, technologies, technicalities, prototypes, procedures, and existing policies; analyse local realities and issues; adopt and adjust to geopolitics and emerging global dynamics; and discern and implement possible solutions. For example, a minister of industry, commerce, and supply, in Nepal, to effectively and efficiently fulfil his or her role, and needs, in addition to formal education, at least some professional background, an understanding of the business environment, issues of small industries, managerial skills, industrial exposure and experience, and procedural knowledge of supply chain and logistics to solve the problems of the business and industrial sectors in Nepal. Similarly, to bring about economic growth in Nepal, we need a finance minister who, apart from understanding the basic concepts of economics and finance, can engage with multinational corporations and foreign investors, understand their concerns, and formulate financial policies and decisions that are suitable for creating an enabling business environment in Nepal. If such things happen, they can also create global strategic alliances for the expansion of investment in Nepal.  As a result, to achieve the economic aspirations and expectations of the Nepali people, a finance minister needs to have the sufficient professional background to deal with and engage with economic realities at the global, regional, and local levels and to connect them together to maximise economic growth in Nepal. Hence, political parties, apart from preferring full-time politicians and political workers as ministers, also need to promote and select them in the National Assembly or House of Representatives and give professionals with suitable expertise, skills, and institutional experiences ministerial roles for an effective and efficient functioning of the government that fulfils the aspirations and expectations of the people in Nepal.",political

Karl Marx’s socialism in Nepal: Reflections on the ongoing struggle,"Nepal has been in political turmoil since the  overthrow of the monarchy  in 2008. The country has seen various governments. However, none of these governments has been able to deliver on their promises of social justice and economic prosperity. The country remains one of the poorest in Asia, with high levels of poverty, unemployment and inequality. Yet, there is a consistent dream of socialism in Nepal. It seems  socialism in Nepal  through the lens of Karl Marxis is the only viable solution to the country’s problems.  The struggle for socialism Karl Marx , the father of socialism, believed that the capitalist system was inherently exploitative and unjust and that the working class must unite to overthrow it. He argued that socialism, in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the workers themselves, would lead to a fairer and more equitable society. Nepal is a country with a large working-class population and the ongoing struggle for socialism in the country can be seen as a continuation of Marx’s ideas. The struggle for socialism in Nepal is rooted in the country’s history of feudalism and exploitation. Marx argued that the capitalist system was built on the exploitation of the working class by the capitalist class. In Nepal, the ruling class has historically been made up of feudal landlords and the monarchy. The struggle for socialism in Nepal, therefore, is a struggle against this feudal system and the exploitation of the working class. The Maoist-led government that came to power in Nepal in 2008 was seen by many as a step towards socialism. The government promised to redistribute land to the landless, provide free education and healthcare and create jobs for the unemployed. However, the government was unable to deliver on these promises. Since then, the struggle for socialism in Nepal has continued, with various political parties and groups advocating socialism. The Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist(CPN-UML) is currently the largest political party in the country and has a socialist agenda. The party has promised to create a socialist society in Nepal, with public ownership of key industries and services. For centuries, Nepal was ruled by a small elite of powerful landlords and aristocrats, who owned vast estates and controlled the country’s resources. The majority of the population, who were mostly peasants and labourers, were forced to work for these landlords and were paid very little for their labour. The struggle for socialism in Nepal gained momentum in the 20th century, with the establishment of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) in 1949  The CPN, which was inspired by the teachings of Marx and Lenin, sought to overthrow the feudal system and establish a socialist society in Nepal. The party’s efforts were met with resistance from the ruling elite, who saw the CPN as a threat to their power and wealth. In the 1990s, Nepal underwent a period of political and social upheaval, with the establishment of multi-party democracy and the adoption of a new constitution that recognised the rights of workers and peasants. However, these reforms did not go far enough to address the underlying issues of poverty, inequality and exploitation that were still prevalent in Nepali society. Today, Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a large percentage of the population living below the poverty line. The struggle for socialism in Nepal continues, with the CPN-Maoist Centre party leading the charge for a socialist revolution. The party’s platform includes the nationalisation of industries, the establishment of a planned economy and the abolition of feudalism and landlordism. Difficult yet continuous path While the road to socialism in Nepal is fraught with challenges and obstacles, the teachings of Karl Marx continue to inspire and guide the struggle for a more just and equitable society. As Marx himself wrote, “The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.” The people of Nepal are working to change their world, and the struggle for socialism continues. Overall, the provisions of socialism in Nepal aim to create a society that is more just, equitable, and sustainable. There are several challenging things on the road to socialism in Nepal, including: 1. : Nepal has experienced  political instability  for many years, which has hindered the implementation of socialist policies. 2. : Nepal is a developing country with a weak economy. The country faces challenges like poverty, unemployment, and underdevelopment, which make it difficult to implement socialist policies. 3 Corruption  is a major challenge in Nepal, which undermines the implementation of socialist policies and programmes. 4.   Many people in Nepal are not aware of the principles and benefits of socialism, which makes it difficult to build a strong socialist movement. 5.   The ruling class in Nepal, which includes the wealthy and powerful, may resist socialist policies that threaten their interests. 6.  : Nepal is a small country that is vulnerable to external pressures from powerful countries and international organisations, which may not support socialist policies. 7.   Implementing socialist policies requires significant resources, expertise, and coordination, which may be difficult to achieve in Nepal’s current context. Overall, the road to socialism in Nepal is challenging, but with determination, commitment, and effective governance, it is possible to overcome these challenges and build a more just and equitable society. Socialism in the context of Nepal’s Constitution In Nepal, socialism is one of the guiding principles of the country’s constitution. The constitution of Nepal defines socialism as a political ideology that aims to establish a society that is free from exploitation, oppression, and inequality. The provisions of socialism in Nepal include: But there are several reasons why Nepal has not been able to establish a socialist state even though it is mentioned in the constitution. a)  : Nepal faces a shortage of resources, both human and financial. This makes it difficult to create an atmosphere conducive to the development of socialism. b)  : Nepal is still a largely conservative society with strong traditional values and beliefs. These values are often contrary to socialist principles, making it difficult to implement them. c)  : The Maoist insurgency in Nepal from 1996-2006 had a major impact on the country’s stability and development. The insurgency caused economic disruption and displacement of people, making it even more difficult for Nepal to establish a socialist state. In conclusion, Nepal’s ongoing struggle for socialism can be seen as a continuation of Karl Marx’s ideas. The country’s history of feudalism and exploitation has created a deep-seated desire for social justice and economic equality. While previous governments have failed to deliver on their promises, the struggle for socialism in Nepal continues.",political

What does the RSP’s landslide in by-elections mean to major parties in Nepal?,"There is a lot of anger in the society right now. For some reason or another, people are angry with the major parties in Nepal or the political establishment. That has helped  Rabi Lamichhane  and his  Rastriya Swatantra Party to win two  out of the three constituencies with ease. In Bara 2, Upendra Yadav, with help from the ruling coalition, won as he  beat Shiva Chandra Kushwaha  of CK Raut’s Janamat party. The by-elections were a matter of prestige for Lamichhane. Having shocked everyone in the general elections in November 2022, he knew if he wanted to maintain what the party had achieved, he had to win Chitwan 2 and Swarnim Wagle had to win Tanahun 1. Lamichhane’s RSP did both as both he and Wagle won comfortably. It is impossible to tell how this party, which emerged a few months ago, will do in the next general elections in 2027. But if the result of these by-elections and the past elections are anything to go by, it is evident that RSP has a great chance to win a lot of seats in both the local and federal elections and establish itself as one of the major parties in Nepal. This is a remarkable achievement for an emerging political party. Not only did Lamichanne get a landslide, but he also helped Wagle do the same. Lamichhane got more votes than he did when he won in November 2022 and led Wagle to victory in a constituency dominated by Nepali Congres for years. This was only possible as the party contested the election in Tanahu. 1 by fielding an expert and a seasoned professional in Swarim Wagle.  This is huge in the sense that it has also given a message to members of major parties in Nepal, the Nepali Congress in particular, who have not got opportunities to get out of the parties and go elsewhere where they will be given a fair chance. And, there are plenty of Nepali Congress members who are frustrated with how the party has been run. It means the two landslide victories will encourage disgruntled cadres in major parties in Nepal to get free and join new forces. People’s need for change It is quite symbolic that the Nepali Congress lost heavily in President Ram Chandra Paudel’s backyard in Tanahun 1. Despite being a strong and qualified candidate, Govinda Bhattarai did not even get the votes Nepali Congress won in federal elections in November 2022. This constituency, which had always chosen Nepali Congress, chose to ring the bell this time as it decided to discard the status quo. This is sure to have a long-term impact on major parties in Nepal, at least in this district. Politics in the country is changing and these by-elections and the rise of the RSP are examples. This is proof that politics will no longer run just by pleasing party leadership as it seems the people want merit-based politics now. So this loss in Tanahun 1 is ringing alarm bells for Nepali Congress, which will need an upheaval. If not, people will not vote for the leaders it puts out in the elections in 2027. The same applies to other major parties in Nepal. This time, the CPN-UML was just watching things unfold from afar. Apart from a few, none of the central UML leaders took strong ownership during these by-elections. The results speak for themselves. The UML’s vote has decreased significantly compared to the elections held in Chitwan and Tanahun. Winning was out of the question, but the UML did not even compete, which should be worrisome for the party leadership. Major parties’ positioning Lamichhane is the only leader who did something in these by-elections. He won; he helped Swarnim Wagle win, and he even went to Bara to help RSP candidate Ramesh Kharel. More importantly, he defeated the coalition and the UML, that is to say, all major parties in Nepal, at the same time. Even though the Congress-UML alliance that was being worked to beat Lamichhane broke on before the by-elections, it was evident that it was Lamichhane vs all major parties in Nepal. And, Lamichhane beat everyone else and did it without breaking a sweat as even if the coalition had been formed, it would have made zero difference. Another interesting aspect of these elections is the Maoist Centre and its chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal. These elections did not mean much for the party that once shook the country and is currently leading the government on behalf of the ruling coalition. It was as if the election fever did not reach the party. This is an illustration of it losing its relevance rather than its lack of a strategic plan. Things are changing in Madhesh too. Leaders like Upendra Yadav and Rajendra Mahato who used the term Madheshism to promote the Madhesh-based agenda are slowly being outcasted by the people. Yadav, who once was a hero in the region, has had to use the coalition to take on Janamat Party’s Kushwaha. Yadav won but only narrowly, and that shows a line is being drawn on his political career. Long-term impacts In the run-up to the by-elections, three former prime ministers–heading different major parties in Nepal–used the same platform to make promises to the people, and the current Prime Minister Dahal said that Govinda Bhattarai, Nepali Congress’ candidate in Tanahun, would become a minister if he won. But the voters rejected all of their pleas and chose a candidate they believed in.  The simple meaning of this is that the people of Chitwan and Tanahun have not only chosen the RSP, but they have also rejected other major parties in Nepal. In the same way, contrary to the general belief that the main opposition gains losses of the ruling side, the UML could not gain anything this time. If it is considered a trend rather than a blip, and if it continues for the next few years, it can be considered that existing major parties in Nepal will struggle heavily in the next elections. Reasons and remedy Why is there increasing anger in the society? For a large number of people who make their living from labour and farming, whether or not  Nepal is turning into Sri Lanka  is of little importance. What they care about is leopards coming into their home and killing their goats or monkeys coming and destroying their crops. They also care about not being able to pay back loans they used to send their children abroad. These are the issues people want to be addressed by major parties in Nepal, but every time, they are left disappointed. On the contrary, some leaders or their aides are involved in this.  Families in villages can no longer put up jewellery as collateral and take loans the microfinance companies and loan sharks have taken it a long time ago. If you go to villages, you will notice how many women have nothing on their ears, nose or necks. This is what these people want to stop. Lamichhane has won this by-election based on the pain that millions of Nepalis are going through. Yes, these problems will not go away by waving a magic wand. These issues can only be solved by bringing structural change within the country. So Lamichhane will have issues as he has given a lot of populist promises to people, which will be very hard to fulfil given the current state of the country. What the RSP has done in less than a year is remarkable and is a slap on all the major parties in Nepal, some of which are nearly eight decades old. However, King Gyanendra and the Maoists are examples of how people’s support is not always sustainable. It is up to Lamichhane if he wants to learn from the mistakes made by them.

Swarnim Wagle wins it big in Tanahun 1,"Kathmandu, April 25 Rastriya Swatantra Party’s candidate Swarnim Wagle has won the  House of Representatives  by-election in Tanahun 1 held on Sunday. As per the results published by the voting officials in the wee hours of Tuesday, the famed economist garnered 34,919 votes, which is 14,797 more than his closest rival Govinda Bhattarai of the Nepali Congress. Bhattarai was restricted to 20,122 votes. This is considered a big loss to the House’s biggest party, Nepali Congress, for two reasons. Firstly, Swarnim Wagle, until a month ago, was a Nepali Congress cadre who  defected to the populist RSP  just on the eve of the candidacy announcement, saying the old party’s leadership tried to corner him.  Secondly, Tanahun 1 was the seat of the veteran Nepali Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel, who had to resign as a lawmaker after being  elected as the president of the country . Meanwhile, former Nepal Police chief Sarvendra Khanal, who contested the election as the CPN-UML candidate, received only 8,488 votes. Vote counting is underway in Chitwan 2 and Bara 2.

Loktantra Day: Recalling major incidents of 2006 people’s movement,"Today is the Loktantra Day (Democracy Day) in Nepal. Then King Gyanendra, on this day, in 2006, had reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives as a result of a 19-day-long people’s revolution popularly known as  People Movement/Janaandolan II . This was a movement against the royal coup staged by King Gyanendra in February 2005 that eventually resulted in the abolition of the 240-year-long monarchy in the country. Here, let’s mark the celebration of this historic day that paved the way for a federal democratic republic, by getting to know the timeline of the events that happened in those 19 days of revolution. : King Gyanendra dismissed the cabinet led by Sher Bahadur Deuba and took all executive powers into his hand. : The signing of a twelve-point agreement between the Seven Parties’ Alliance (SPA) and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist) in New Delhi to wage a unified mass movement against the monarchy built the foundation for the Janaandolan II. : The SPA boycotted municipal elections. The SPA announced a nationwide peaceful pro-democracy people’s movement. Initially, it was a nationwide general four-day strike, but it lasted for 19 days. On  the first day of the movement , more than 450 protestors were arrested and many political activists were kept under house arrest.  Also, the Maoists attacked Malangwa, Sarlahi in central Terai as King Gyanendra had gone to Birgunj, Parsa, for inaugurating the World Hindu Convention despite several warnings from political parties. Demonstrations across Nepal rippled; buildings were vandalised; tyres were burnt; roads were blocked. King Gyanendra retaliated against the demonstrations by imposing a curfew in Kathmandu with a ban on mass meetings, assemblies, rallies, and sit-in programmes within Kathmandu’s Ring Road. Telephone and mobile phone connections were suspended. Also, around 25 people died in a clash between security forces and the Maoists in western Nepal, mainly in Kapilvastu and Rupandehi. Likewise, a demonstrator in Chitwan was shot dead. The Maoists had blocked all the major highways and 12-hour curfews had become a schedule. The SPA called for a tax boycott and declared to continue the movement indefinitely. Many civil servants and professionals comprising lawyers, teachers, engineers, professors, doctors and journalists and many others joined the movement. Curfew hours were reduced.  The movement intensified in the following days, with crowds increasing to sizes  estimated at 100,000 to 200,000  in Kathmandu. Curfews for the daytime were lifted. However, more than 500 professionals including journalists, lawyers, human rights activists, and many other agitators were arrested by the security forces.  It was New Year’s Day. On this occasion, addressing the nation, the king called the political parties for the talks. However, the parties rejected the call continued the protest. Likewise, the government also intensified its brutality against the demonstrators. Owing to international pressures and protests, King Gyanendra met political leaders. After this meeting, many leaders including CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal and Nepali Congress General Secretary Ram Chandra Poudel were released.  The king imposed a 25-hour curfew in Kathmandu. Likewise, three protestors were killed in Kalanki of the city while defying the curfew orders. Also, police stations distributing curfew passes to the media and the UN staffers were closed down and the passes were denied.        On the very day, the king put forth an offer to nominate Nepali Congress leader, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, as the new prime minister. However, he refused.       Protests reached their peak with over 500,000 agitators on the street. Several individuals were killed and hundreds were injured with police firing bullets and tear gas shells, and charging batons. In the same evening, on a television statement, the king announced a new offer stating he would return all the executive powers to the people and requested the SPA to recommend the name of the prime minister who would run the government. But, this was also refused. Thousands of people filled Kathmandu’s 27-km Ring Road surrounding the city. The leaders presented their three core demands that included the reinstatement of the dissolved parliament, formation of an all-party government, and elections to a constituent assembly (that would draft a new constitution). Also, the protesters in a huge number marched towards the palace defying the curfew orders. There was an 11-hour curfew and ‘shoot-at-sight’ order in Kathmandu. Despite such a situation, the SPA leaders announced a “mammoth Ring Road rally” for April 25. Schools, shops, businesses and government offices were closed for 19 days. Finally, after 19 days of the protests, the movement came to its climax with King Gyanendra reinstating the old House of Representatives, which was dissolved in February 2005. The king called upon the SPA to unify the nation. And, the SPA accepted it. From the  archives .",political
PM Dahal directs officials to make provisions for the registration of made-in-Nepal vehicles,"Kathmandu, April 23 Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has stressed the need for drafting a law for the registration of made-in-Nepal vehicles.  During his meeting with Chief Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi today, the prime minister asked him to prepare a law ensuring the registration of vehicles made in Nepal and adopt a policy for promoting Nepali products.  As  the prime minister said , his attention has been drawn to media concerns over the  absence of provision of registering motor vehicles manufactured within the country .  Following the PM’s direction, the chief secretary talked to the secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, Madhu Marasini, and asked him to prepare a draft of the law regarding the registration and promotion of motor vehicles produced within the country and present it before the House, it is said.",political
Gandaki: CM Khaga Raj Adhikari loses office after vote of confidence test,"Pokhara, April 23 Gandaki Chief Minister Khaga Raj Adhikari lost his position on Saturday after he could not obtain the vote of confidence of the Provincial Assembly during a vote held in Pokhara. Only 24 of the 60-member assembly voted in favour of Adhikari of the CPN-UML continuing  his office . Adhikari was elected the chief minister in January following the elections in November 2022.  He  could not rule long  following a  change in the federal-level coalition , following which the CPN-Maoist Centre in the province withdrew its support from the government, hence requiring Adhikari to face the test. Now, the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre are preparing to form a new government in the province. However, they are yet to decide who is leading the government.",political
Pondering on Prachanda: Will Pushpa Kamal Dahal make any difference in the final innings?,"Following some tangible loopholes in the constitution and severe erosion of civilised culture, Nepali politics is regularly wrapped in unsolicited irregularities and a series of nauseatingly deep instabilities. One of its exclusive outcomes is the intermittent change of the executive head of the nation. In the sequel, Pushpa Kamal  Dahal, better known as Prachanda , the president of the Maoist Centre, is elected as the 44th prime minister and as the 27th in a 32-year democratic exercise from 1990 onwards. He has experienced a rare incidence of commanding a vote of confidence from the  parliament  two times in consecutive two months. But the House, which has constituted and confirmed him as premier of the nation, is certain to beget at least three prime ministers within the next three years. It is his third, undoubtedly the final, term as well, thus people have hoped he does something better and memorable. However, initial batting and chunks of challenges seldom signal so. The golden chance It is a separate debate that whether it was a good time for Pushpa Kamal Dahal to head the government has not much significance, though in a kingmaker position, presence in the House. Nonetheless, being the PM is a very rational and right choice for him, in this span of time. Despite his claim of being only a dedicated party for the people, it is under great doubt whether people still elect the  Maoists  with any sizable status in the future. He may never gain the chance again. And, former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, who once charged him a traitor and tagged price on his head, is his supporter. Making Deuba a subordinate might have psychologically gratified Pushpa Kamal Dahal a lot. But how gratified people will be this time with his government is a riddle to further assess.   Thus, it is a great occasion for Dahal but it is a challenging time to purify the ruined prestige. Despite being the first republic prime minister following the first Constituent Assembly’s election and rising as the largest party of the then period, he failed to carry out impressive actions for the people. Moreover, Pushpa Kamal Dahal was engaged in other issues, which had neither any immediate value nor were in public expectations. Thus, he not only dwindled the party’s status but even eroded its own prestige too. The second innings too were not much evident and effective to people.  Now, he has a golden opportunity to regain the ruined image. For it, he should accomplish two sorts of activities: one of the immediate needs and the second of the long-term values, respectively. But the vehicle seems to take reverse gear again. Immediate needs As a couple of new and fringe political parties are also  claiming an oversized stake in the government , Pushpa Kamal Dahal has to endeavour his best to take them in consensus by addressing genuine expectations. Differentiating the organic demands from invited-cum-invented ones, he has to commence bringing them in confidence and mitigating the potential bellicosity. Dealing with it is a tough and taxing task. But he never should seem like lazing on it. Implementation of change issues, which are endorsed in the constitution as well, with good consensus among parties is an exacting but pressing job for him. Secularism, federalism and republicanism should be institutionalised without any doubts and dread to people.  But deceleration in those issues seems further erasing Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s credibility. Increasing graphs of black marketing, robberies, murders and lootings, institutional irregularities, apathy and inactions should be stringently granulated.  Adopting balanced foreign policy and improving the Indo-Nepal nexus is another significant stressing point. Besides, he should strive for substantive cum sustainable development of the nation. Sustainable success With the new republic, secular and federal constitution, now a series of political changes are over. This is the time to care about economic proliferation. The economic prosperity of a nation matters more than any other rhetoric. We have a recent history that a single financial fluctuation that made European and American countries quite weak though being politically stable for a long. Nepal’s neighbours, mostly East Asian nations, have earned inexplicably exponential economic growth, recently. A single project incurs capacious value in the economic development of countries if operated seriously. Samsung Company alone bears about 30 per cent of the GDP in South Korea. Singapore has 82,000$ plus PCI. Japan and Thailand have marvellously improved many times in the last two decades. China has reportedly brought 660 million people over the poverty line. But Nepal is a mere witness to them. Only economic development matters to people; and in its absence, no political experimentation prospers. Pushpa Kamal Dahal should remain apparently determined to take some bold efforts to economically lift up the country from a vulnerable to a victorious mood.  But chances seem to be quite rare. At least, former PM KP Sharma Oli had made people dream during his first innings but those tall promises were wrecked with a dwarf, dismal performance in the second innings. Though those are not immediately possible but are undeniable as if we are desperate for development. Success obviously demands dreaming; imagination is hyper-reality.  Pushpa Kamal Dahal should now take off a few plans, which immediately mark positive impacts on public lives. People should feel the rule of law. Anarchy, impunity, corruption, nepotism and partisan preferences must receive significant discouragement. The investment-friendly environment should be fairly initiated. Actions have to be delivered in a way that the youth love the nation and foresee the future here. Some extraordinary and visionary plans are a must to alleviate poverty, promote employability and command financial sustainability. Some powerful breakthroughs are a must; so, people would feel that Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s politics is for people and their empowerment, in this innings. He has challenges, but he has to address them without any excuses and alibies. Final truth If these missions are made, Pushpa Kamal Dahal will mend and then rebuild degraded and dwindled dignity. But on gross failure on these issues, it seems that his regime too will be an ordinary futile foul play to pollute the politics. He too may slip from being a golden gain of politics in order to chop out the regular pain of the nation. Then, this also will be unsuccessful experimentation again. Thus, he has to ponder deeply and power up much for public acceptability and credibility. The final innings should be fruitful.",political
Why all alternative parties in Nepal should drop their differences and come together,"The emergence of  alternative parties  in Nepal is a response to the widespread dissatisfaction with the established parties and the country’s political system. While these parties represent a diverse range of ideologies and interests, they share a common goal of bringing about change and reforming the country’s political landscape. Still, it is not easy for new parties to establish themselves in a  political landscape  dominated by existing parties. These parties often have established networks, resources and support bases, which make it difficult for  new entrants  to gain a foothold.  Moreover, the political culture in Nepal is often characterised by  corruption , nepotism and favouritism, which can create barriers for alternative parties in Nepal that want to offer a clean and transparent alternative. To be successful in achieving common goals and values, these  alternative parties in Nepal  must come together and form a united front. These may include issues such as anti-corruption, social justice, human rights and sustainable development. By identifying these shared values, the parties can build a sense of solidarity and purpose that can help to overcome their ideological differences. Establishing an alliance After identifying shared values, the parties can establish a platform that outlines the policies and programmes that the alliance of alternative parties in Nepal will prioritise. This platform should be based on the shared values of the parties and should be developed through a collaborative and transparent process. It should also be communicated effectively to the public so that voters understand what the alliance stands for and what they can expect if they vote for them. Then, they should build a strong and inclusive organisation that can effectively represent the alliance and mobilise support from the grassroots level. This can involve establishing local chapters in different regions of the country, recruiting volunteers and engaging with civil society organisations and other interest groups. Likewise, they should develop a comprehensive strategy for the elections, including campaign messaging, fundraising and outreach. This strategy should be based on a thorough understanding of the electoral landscape and the voting patterns of different regions and demographic groups. The alliance of alternative parties in Nepal should prioritise transparency and accountability in its operations, to differentiate its constituents from the established political parties that are often perceived as corrupt and unresponsive to the needs of the people this can be challenging, as these parties often have differing views and priorities.  By collaborating and pooling their resources, they can create a stronger, more viable alternative to the established parties. Creating credible alternative Then, alternative parties in Nepal should coordinate their activities and campaigns and include joint rallies and protests, as well as coordinate messaging and media outreach. By presenting a united front, these parties can amplify their message and gain greater visibility and public support. In addition, these parties can also explore the possibility of forming a coalition in the parliament. This would involve collaborating to gain a majority in the parliament and working together to implement their shared agenda. While this approach can be challenging, it has been successful in other countries where alternative political parties have formed coalitions to govern. However, coming together and forming a united front also presents challenges in front of alternative parties in Nepal. These parties may have ideological differences and disagreements over policy priorities. Furthermore, there may be questions about leadership and decision-making within the coalition. To overcome these challenges, these parties must engage in open dialogue and be willing to compromise and work towards a common goal. The success of alternative parties in Nepal will depend on their ability to come together and form a united front. By identifying common goals, coordinating their activities and exploring the possibility of forming a coalition government, these parties can present a credible alternative to the established parties and bring about the change and reform that Nepal desperately needs. However, this will require collaboration, compromise and a shared vision for the future of the country. In conclusion, for alternative political parties to overcome the dirty politics of Nepal and replace the old established parties, they need to come together and form a united front that is based on shared values, a common platform and a comprehensive strategy.  By doing so, they can offer a credible and effective alternative to the existing political system and make a meaningful impact on the country’s future. Thus, alternative political parties can be a potential solution to address this  long history of political instability and corruption . For these, all alternative parties in Nepal need to come together and form a cohesive alliance that can challenge the established political parties in the country.",political
Supreme Court tells Kathmandu mayor to resume collecting waste from Singhadarbar,"Kathmandu, April 21 The  Supreme Court  has handed down an order to  Kathmandu  Mayor Balen Shah to resume collecting waste from Singhadarbar, the central administrative complex of the federal government where most ministries are located. Hearing a writ petition filed by advocate Padam Bahadur Shrestha, a single bench of Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut issued the order telling Shah to immediately resume the waste collection. It has been nearly two weeks since  Shah stopped collecting  waste from the complex, saying the federal government did not cooperate with the local one.

Federal-local govt tussle: Literally dirty politics that’s making Singhadarbar stinky explained,"Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah, apparently, has been frustrated with the lack of help from the central government ever since he was  elected by the people of Nepal’s capital  in May last year. As soon as he took over as mayor of the  Kathmandu metropolitan city , he had to  deal with issues regarding Kathmandu’s waste disposal . After locals of Bancharedanda obstructed garbage trucks from entering the landfill, Shah argued that major political parties were playing politics with waste. It is nearly been a year since Balen Shah was elected as mayor and even now, the waste issue has not been solved. The locals of Bancharedanda, time and again, obstruct vehicles from entering the area stating their demands have not been met.  Now, Shah, wanting to prove a point, has said he will  not pick up waste from Singhadarbar , the seat of the federal government, and is trying to use this as a bargaining ploy to ensure the  demands he put in front of the government  are met. So why are both sides adamant on their stances, thereby blocking a middle-path solution? And, what can Kathmanduites expect next?  Shah’s claims On April 8, Balen Shah presented 14 examples of non-cooperation from the federal government and stated that he would not pick up waste from Singhadarbar, the central administrative complex of the government. Following that, many people from the federal government asked Shah not to play politics with waste. Shah, however, is not budging. The Minister for Urban Development Sita Gurung requested Shah to come for talks. But Shah has taken a firm stance and said he would only hold talks with either Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal or Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. Balen Shah is particularly frustrated with how Singhadarbar has not supported the plan of the metropolis to  remove squatters from the banks of the Bagmati river . Shah has repeatedly asked for support but received none. That is not all. He wants help from the federal government with traffic light management, pedestrian pavements encroached upon by foreign missions,  digital TV in government schools,  transfer of teachers and timely salaries, government hospital cleanliness, health insurance for people living near dumping sites and the destruction of the top floor of the Ministry of Health which has been built illegally. He said the government has not given him enough budget for the national ambulance either. The metropolis has asked for other projects to be moved ahead including the blueprint development of Tribhuvan International Airport, the Tinkune area compensation issue, the building of Sankhadhar Sakhwa Park in the airport and the connection of Yangri and Larke rivers into the Melamchi water project for a hassle-free water supply. Shah also said Singhadarbar needs to allow the metropolis to take corporate rental tax too. Shah is also demanding that the federal government should help manage river corridors, assist in cleaning rivers, establish sewage treatment plants, build underpasses, build leachate treatment plants in Bancharedanda, and manage alternative roads, soil capping and gas pipes in Sisdol and Bancharedanda. Shah alleges that the federal government is now helping the metropolis make laws and providing land for waste management in Kathmandu. He demanded that the expansion of the ring road, formation of the Valley Transport Authority, integrated infrastructure development operation between the internet service provider companies and Nepal Telecom for wire-pole management, and street lighting management should also be supported. Mayor Shah is demanding that the metropolis should get help from Singhadarbar in the management of Melamchi’s water and pipes as well as Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Limited. He complains that cooperative laws and regulations should be tightened, public land should be protected, staff transfer should be regular and transparent, fertilisers should be purchased and vegetables brought to the valley should be tested, etc. He alleges that despite repeated discussions with the concerned ministers, no progress has been made. “When they don’t address issues put forward by the local government that is only 500 metres away (from Singhadarbar), how can we expect the government to address issues put forward by municipalities in remote areas,” Shah wrote on Facebook.  He says that a federal government that does not listen, understand and prioritise concerns raised by the local governments and people’s representatives, is not working towards strengthening federalism in the country. Shah says that he is not picking up waste from Singhaduabar to force the federal government to listen to and create an environment to ensure people stop coming to Kathmandu for treatment, and education and to ask for justice in the federal country. “Why doesn’t the government work to make other cities and villages better,” he questions. “They need to be put under pressure.” Singhadarbar’s response The federal government has formally opposed the mayor’s decision not to pick up waste from Singhadarbar. After the cabinet meeting on April 12, the government’s spokesperson, Minister of Communication and Information Technology Rekha Sharma reminded that there is a policy arrangement to collect the garbage of the valley at the local level.  Besides calls for the talks by Urban Development Minister Gurung, Prime Minister Dahal and Home Minister Shrestha have not made any response yet.  Instead, officials are expressing frustration. An official of the Ministry of Urban Development says, “The old style of turning waste into a weapon to meet their demands has continued.” Former government secretary Kishor Thapa recalls that previous mayors have also tried using his tactic. Both PL Singh and Keshav Sthapit refused to pick up waste from Singhadarbar when they refused to work in the metropolis’ favour. Thapa says Shah was forced to do this after getting frustrated with the federal government. He believes the government has not provided the metropolis with technical support, budget, human resource and equipment as per the law. “As the capital city, the problems of Kathmandu are different, hence the responsibility of the metropolis is also different compared to other cities,” says Thapa. “If there is non-cooperation or repression, the metropolis will show its weapons.” So, what’s next? The constitution has given the responsibility of waste management to the local level. For that, the federal government at Singhadarbar has to support the local government in building infrastructure. The federal government is in the process of handing over the landfill site in Bancharedanda and the road leading to it to the metropolis. Meanwhile, there is no unanimity within the metropolis on the mayor’s decision to stop the collection, transportation and disposal of waste belonging to essential services. Deputy Mayor Sunita Dangol says that the city government has not made an official decision not to pick up the waste from Singhadarbar. She says this issue has not been talked about in the municipal meeting. “Mayor may have used his executive authority to stop the waste of Singhadarbar,” she says. “I think that the solution to the problem should be found through intergovernmental coordination.”  Navin Manandhar, the spokesperson for the city government, also says there was no discussion at the municipal meeting or with the ward chairs about not picking up the waste from Singhadarbar.  “There is no question that the federal and provincial governments should support the work of the metropolis,” he says. But Mayor Shah is not in favour of listening to anyone other than having a one-on-one talk with Singhadarbar. Sunil Lamsal, the focal person of his secretariat looking after waste management, says that the waste will not be removed until Shah holds talks with key personnel at Singhadarbar. “The city government was forced to not pick up the garbage because of non-cooperation. We will not pick it up until we hold talks with the prime minister,” he says. The federal government, on the other hand, is trying to put all the blame on Mayor Shah and the local government. “Garbage is something that smells, spoils the environment, and spreads diseases! Isn’t it imprudent to say that the Ministry of Home Affairs did not send the police to remove the slums so that the garbage is not picked up?” the official at the Urban Development Ministry questions. The official said Shah is playing politics like any other person by doing this in the capital of the country. He says that Shah’s latest insistence will send a message that any demand could be met by putting pressure like this. “Such a trend will cause more suffering to the people than to the government tomorrow,” says the official, who does not want to be named. “The rooms of the air-conditioned offices will not smell the stench from the garbage. It is the common people who will suffer.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Proportional representation system in Nepal elections: A boon or a curse?,"Proportional representation  is a widely used electoral system around the world, including in Nepal. This system aims to provide fair representation to all communities in government, unlike other systems that may favour the majority group.  Despite being implemented for more than a decade in Nepal, the impact of the proportional representation system is still a matter of debate among the people. Some argue that it has brought diversity and representation while others claim that it has led to instability and weak governance.  So how can it be determined? Is it a blessing or a curse? And what is its impact on the Nepali people? The pros and cons of the proportional representation system The proportional representation system is designed to ensure that all groups and communities are represented fairly in the government. It aims to eliminate the dominance of a single group in the government and ensure that all groups have equal representation. In Nepal, where caste and ethnicity play a significant role in politics, the proportional representation system has helped reduce the dominance of certain groups. The system encourages political parties to be more inclusive in their policies and promotes diversity in the  government.  One of the significant advantages of the system is the increased representation of marginalised communities in the government. It ensures that all communities, regardless of their size or strength, are represented in the government. The system has helped reduce the dominance of certain groups in the government and promoted diversity. It encourages political parties to be more inclusive in their policies, resulting in better representation of all communities. The system has also led to the reduction of regional and caste-based politics. Political parties are required to consider the entire country when making policies and they cannot rely solely on the support of one region or community. This has led to the development of national policies that benefit all Nepali people, regardless of their caste or ethnicity. Additionally, it increases the accountability of elected representatives as they are held responsible for their performance by a larger and more diverse group of constituents.  However, there are also arguments against the proportional representation system. One of the significant disadvantages of the proportional system is the frequent changes in the coalition, which have led to instability in the government.  The frequent changes can negatively impact policy decisions and implementation. Small parties may also have a disproportionate amount of power, which can lead to gridlock in decision-making.  Another challenge is the increased expenses for the government due to the need for more representatives and resources. The proportional representation system requires more representatives to be elected, which leads to increased expenses for the government. This can be a significant challenge for developing countries like Nepal, which already face financial constraints. The first-past-the-post system vs proportional representation The  first-past-the-post system , also known as the winner-takes-all system is another popular electoral system used in many countries worldwide. This system has its advantages also such as providing a clear winner in the election and simplicity in voting.  However, the system does not necessarily guarantee fair representation for all groups and communities.  For example, in countries where a single group dominates politics, the first-past-the-post system can lead to the underrepresentation of other groups.  In such cases, the proportional representation system may be a better option to ensure fair representation for all communities.  In Nepal, where diversity is an essential aspect of society and politics, the system has been a good fit.  The system ensures that all groups regardless of their size or strength are represented in the government. It has helped reduce the dominance of certain groups and promote diversity in the government.  When we compare Nepal’s proportional representation system to that in other countries, we see that it has its unique advantages and disadvantages. In New Zealand, for example, the proportional system has been used since 1996 and has led to increased political participation and engagement. The proportional representation system has encouraged people to participate in politics and has made the government more accessible to the people. In contrast, the system has faced criticism in countries such as Israel and Italy, where it has led to instability and frequent changes in government.  So what next? In such cases, policymakers need to explore ways to improve the system, such as reducing the number of parties or implementing a mixed electoral system. The ultimate goal is to establish a fair and stable electoral system that benefits all Nepali people, regardless of their background or political affiliation. This is crucial for the country to achieve its full potential and create a prosperous and inclusive society.",political

How new are new political parties in Nepal?,"We have seen an upsurge of so-called new political parties in  Nepali politics.  Indeed, they are new because they have fresh political faces to proclaim their optimistic intentions. Then, it appears, they have a selfless commitment to radical socio-economic development for the people of this country. In contrast to  old conventional political parties , these new parties do not have dark spots of gross negligence, corruption, or mismanagement on them yet. Hence, the people of Nepal have unbound expectations that these new parties will significantly contribute towards the state’s accountability, transparency and economic growth.  However, only time will tell whether they are really new or whether these new parties are just a one-hit wonder in terms of electoral results or they are here to play long innings on the rather hazardous and unpredictable pitch of Nepali politics. Just the same The main political narrative of these so-called new political parties is that they are here to radically change the political culture of Nepal. However, they continue to support rampant corruption, indecision, instability, political favouritism, abuse of authority and easily compromise to the self-interest of a few political leaders. When we analyse the positive intentions, motives and lofty promises of new political parties with reference to dominant political ideology, existing economic policies, governance modalities and the economic realities of Nepal, it appears that these new parties are not alternatives, distinct from or different from conventional parties. They are only pitching themselves as a better version of or an updated model of old parties by exposing the past failures and shortcomings of conventional parties. The fundamental problem with new political parties is that they have not demarcated themselves as different and distinct from the political ideology, ideas, values, governance modalities, and economic policies of old conventional parties. Clarification needed We are unsure if they are capitalists or economic liberals who support privatisation, foreign investment and free enterprise or socialists, a social welfare party, who favour centralised control of everything, more authoritarian government and expansive development. In terms of political values, where do they stand? Are they secular, conservative, liberal, nationalist, authoritarian, or religious? Just like conventional parties in Nepal, they appear to be a mishmash of everything. For example, Nepal’s political economy is framed from the perspective of socialist ideals and the government operates enterprises related to essential products and services, provides welfare, regulates the market, allows the formation of powerful trade unions and charges high taxes on different goods and services, for government revenue generation. So, given opportunities, are these new parties willing to reduce the size of the government mechanisms to manage additional capital for infrastructure development? If they get the opportunity, will they cut down on welfare schemes and channel financial resources for infrastructure development? Will they also rectify quota systems and promote a merit-based system? Besides, what are their particular tactics for addressing problems like cults of personality, groupism, a preference for funders and autocratic decision-making that are pervasive in Nepali political parties? There are many such tough questions. The new political parties in Nepal have lucidly avoided and ignored them. Hopes and fears Although Lee Kuan Yew, the inaugural prime minister of Singapore, is utterly romanticised in Nepal, we should not forget that he was able to transform his country into a developed country. He implemented relevant economic policies and a governance model based on meritocracy rather than taking populist decisions for short-term political gains. But in the social and political context of Nepal, even gutsy political leaders of new political parties will find it rather challenging to implement tough and unpopular decisions against the existing socio-political and economic schemes of things and the sentiment of their mass voters. A simple analysis of policy objectives and political promises of new political parties reveals that they have chosen to remain completely unaware of the reality. The reality is that the root causes of many socio-economic problems in Nepal are not just associated with political leadership or government failures but are the result of the history, geography, social values, economic policies based on socialist ideals and absolute irresponsibility of people. Indeed, new political parties can always blame the bureaucracy, the judicial system, the global economy, the established press, business tycoons, the sheep-like tendencies of Nepali people, and foreign conspiracies if they fail to materialise their airy-fairy promises. But if they remain rooted in the political ideologies, isms, values, and economic policies of the same old conventional parties, gradually, new political parties in Nepal will find themselves as just another conventional party. After all, it is not promises, gusty voices or new faces that determine political behaviour rather it is political ideas, values and a set of political principles carried by individuals in a party.",political
Political instability is hitting students hard in Nepal. What are its long-term impacts?,"Nepal is a democratic nation which has not been under any exterior governing power to date. However, it has a history of  political instability  since time immemorial. In the current scenario, the main cause of political instability is the struggle among political parties and their leaders for powerful positions at federal, provincial and local levels. Nowadays, politicians and political parties have been self-centred in their position and power  rather than working for the welfare of the citizens . This has led to an impact negatively on the country’s economy, social aspects, security and the psychology of students, who are considered the future of the nation.

It mainly affects the students who are in the phase of pursuing their higher education. Political instability often leads to the interruption of classes. Many times, strikes of various unions or parties lead to school closure. Then, there are times when examinations are delayed or cancelled, which creates an unsafe environment for students to study. Regularly enough, students bear violence and threats, which highly impact their psychology of the students. Moreover, the precariousness and chaos of  political unrest can cause anxiety , stress and depression, which will negatively impact students’ academic performance. Political instability restricts students on the development of personal growth as well as limits the opportunities in each and every sector. So, people in the new generation are  more likely to move on to abroad for pursuing their higher studies  as soon as they complete their school education. Taking my reference, I am also currently a high school graduate and many of my friends have already moved to Australia, Canada and the USA to pursue higher education. In this process of going abroad to pursue higher education, they have to earn pocket money themselves. While talking to them, they say that due to the political instability, many opportunities have been blocked such as students being deprived of quality education, extracurricular activities and job opportunities for students. The future of Nepal If this practice goes on, no youngster will stay in Nepal in the upcoming years. There would not be active people, which means no skilled human resources, and no human resources that will drastically downgrade the development of the nation. And, this is not a good sign at all for a developing country. Meanwhile, corruption has become a major problem in Nepal. Many cases have been flashed out by Nepali media and suspects of political parties are found guilty, which ultimately leads to instability of the government that demotivates students in each and every aspect while pursuing education. Students get frustrated by all those negative attributes, which is not good for the development phase. In order to stop the brain drain, politicians and political parties should be aware of this intimidating situation that students’ psychology has been deeply affected by political instability. Moreover, all parties should cooperate to establish a stable government and should work for the welfare of the nation. They should create different meaningful opportunities towards scholars, which will encourage them to focus on education and stay in Nepal and do productive work for the nation.",political
PM assures Bar of early chief justice appointment,"Kathmandu, April 13 Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has assured the  Nepal Bar Association , the umbrella organisation of Nepali lawyers, that the chief justice appointment process would begin soon. Receiving a memorandum from the association on Thursday, Dahal said the next House of Representatives meeting scheduled for Sunday would endorse the new House Regulations, thereby paving way for the formation of a new Parliamentary Hearing Committee, which will have to endorse the chief justice nominee from the Constitutional Council before the appointment. Dahal said he would call a meeting of the council, headed by the prime minister, as soon as the hearing committee would be established, informs the association’s president Gopal Krishna Ghimire.  Since the  impeachment position filed  against former chief justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana in February 2022, the country’s judiciary is headless.  While Rana was suspended, Deepak Kumar Karki took over as the acting chief justice. But Rana could not resume his position as the  House of Representatives could not complete the impeachment process . Karki then retired handing over the responsibility to Hari Krishna Karki. With the new round of elections taking place in November 2022, there was an expectation that the chief justice appointment would happen soon. However, as the parties remained busy in power games, the issue has not been prioritised yet.",political

Organising a press conference this afternoon, Shrestha said the act of leaking the audiotape from January was a conspiracy against the party. He said he would file a case against the decision at the court and come back with a clean chit.

Why should Nepal introduce a code of conduct for politicians?,"Politics is a noble profession that involves serving the people and working towards their betterment. However, in Nepal, politicians lack a proper code of conduct to regulate their actions. The absence of such a code has led to  corruption,  unethical practices and misuse of power by some politicians.  A code of conduct for politicians is necessary for Nepal now as it would provide a set of ethical standards and principles that guide their behaviour. It would define what constitutes ethical behaviour and set clear boundaries for what is acceptable and unacceptable. It would also outline consequences for violating the code, which would help deter unethical practices. Experiences so far Nepal has experienced several instances of  unethical behaviour by politicians , including corruption and misuse of power. A code of ethics would help prevent such behaviour and promote transparency and accountability. It would also restore public trust in politicians and the political system as a whole. The lack of such a code has also led to the politicisation of government institutions and appointments based on political affiliations rather than merit.  This practice has had a detrimental effect on Nepal’s development and economic growth. A code of conduct would ensure that appointments are based on merit and qualifications rather than political affiliations.  Furthermore, a code of conduct for politicians would help establish a culture of integrity and professionalism. It would encourage politicians to prioritise the people’s interests over their personal gain and promote collaboration and cooperation among political parties. It would also ensure that politicians are held accountable for their actions and are transparent about their decisions and policies. Implementing a code for politicians in Nepal could potentially address some of the challenges faced by the country, such as corruption and lack of accountability. However, there may still be challenges that need to be addressed even after the implementation of the code.  Addressing challenges One challenge is ensuring compliance and enforcement of the code of conduct. This may require a strong and independent oversight body. This body should have the power to investigate and sanction politicians who violate the code.  In Nepal, there have been instances where politicians have violated ethical norms, which may require significant political will and commitment from the government.  Another challenge is changing the political culture in Nepal. Additionally, there may be resistance to the code from those who benefit from the status quo, and navigating political opposition to the code may be a challenge.  Overall, while implementing a code of conduct for politicians in Nepal may be a positive step towards addressing corruption and promoting accountability, it may also require addressing challenges related to compliance, enforcement and changing political culture.  To address these challenges, a multi-pronged approach involving various stakeholders would be necessary. One solution would be to establish an independent oversight body that has the resources and legal authority to monitor compliance and enforce the code of conduct.  This body would investigate and sanction politicians who violate the code, thereby increasing accountability among political leaders.  Another solution would be to increase transparency in political processes such as campaign financing and government procurement. This would help reduce opportunities for corruption and increase public trust in the political system.  Moreover, raising awareness among politicians and the public about the importance of ethical behaviour and the consequences of violating the code of conduct could be done through various means, including training programmes, public campaigns and other outreach efforts.  Addressing the root causes of corruption such as  poverty, inequality and weak governance  would also be necessary to effectively implement the code of conduct. This may require implementing economic and social policies that promote inclusive growth and strengthen institutions.  Finally, fostering a culture of  accountability and integrity among politicians  and the public would involve public education, civic engagement and other initiatives that promote transparency and ethical behaviour. The road ahead Overall, addressing the challenges faced by Nepal after implementing a code of conduct for politicians would require a sustained and collaborative effort among stakeholders from the government, civil society, and the private sector. By implementing a multi-pronged approach, Nepal can effectively tackle corruption and promote ethical behaviour among its political leaders. Some may argue that such a code for politicians is unnecessary and difficult to enforce. However, the existence of a code would establish clear guidelines for ethical behaviour and provide a framework for holding politicians accountable. It would also help prevent unethical practices by promoting a culture of integrity and professionalism. Hence, the need for a code of conduct for politicians in Nepal is crucial. It would promote ethical behaviour, transparency and accountability, which would help Nepal restore public trust in the political system and help establish a culture of integrity and professionalism.  It is time for Nepal’s politicians to prioritise the people’s interests and work towards creating a code of conduct that will help shape a better future for the country. Implementing a code of conduct for politicians in Nepal is an important step in addressing corruption and promoting accountability in the political system.",political

Is identity politics necessary for people’s representation in Nepal?,"Many political parties in Nepal claim to represent people belonging to a particular social class, community or  ethnicity.  They carry the agenda that these people are underrepresented, excluded and marginalised in both public institutions and the  political system in Nepal , hence  identity politics  is necessary. Personally, I support inclusion and affirmative action. However, when we analyse identity politics and representation in the light of contextual political and socio-economic realities, we see contradictions, gaps, confusions, distortions and manipulations everywhere. This necessitates the question of if this is necessary for the true representation of people in Nepal.  The faults in identity politics Firstly, the categorisation of identity for the purpose of making reservations in public institutions and political representation is overarchingly vague and poorly classified. For example, in the categories of Adivasi and Janajati, the Newas of Kathmandu and the Sherpas of the Himalayas are equally represented along with the Tamangs and Magars of the hill ethnicity and the indigenous people of the Terai community. This fuzzy, obscured and unspecific categorisation allows ample space for gross abuse, misinterpretation and misuse of this system. The fundamental issue is that this crude classification fails to take into account the nuanced differences in economic class, gender-based discrimination, unequal access to resources, geographic advantages, private property ownership, the historical and cultural nature of relationships between members of various Nepali ethnic communities and the predominance of social hierarchy within a particular ethnic community. Similarly, just because a millionaire, a feudal landlord, a person who makes a living by painting brick walls, or an individual from the Musahar community share a common ethnic or regional identity, for identity politics, they are all lumped into the same classification. But in reality, a millionaire gets more advantages in politics and other public institutions than a poor person. Hence, poor and underprivileged people within that group always feel that due to another socially privileged and politically powerful ethnicity or community, they are being oppressed, marginalised and deprived of their rightful access to public resources. Here, it is also important to understand that identity politics and representation emerged in the institutions of developed countries, where being poor is no longer a cause for social injustice and discrimination, whereas your gender, sexual, ethnic, racial, or political identity may be. Hence, identity politics does not include the social class differences prevalent among ethnic communities. However, in the Nepali context, poverty and social class differences make a lot of difference when it comes to access to public resources and political opportunities, whatever, region, community or ethnicity one belong to. The prevailing question Indeed, people belonging to the cluster of women, Adivasi Janajati,  Dalit  and Madheshi communities in Nepal are underrepresented in the state machinery. What about those women, Adivasi Janajatis, Dalits and Madheshi people from underdeveloped regions, who, in contrast to the majority of people in their community, are already economically successful, educated, and socially privileged? Are these people sharing any of their achievements and affluence with the people of their community as a part of their collective identity and solidarity? Apart from political narratives and discourses, we do not find anything material or substantive in their contributions. However, when it comes to maximising the benefits generated by identity politics, mostly educated, economically affluent and elite individuals get the most privileges. The least economically privileged and socially backward people make the most sacrifices when it comes to struggling for the representation of their community, region or ethnicity. Additionally, factions, mistrust, and a lack of cooperation, as well as actions driven by limited self-interest, show how completely unconcerned identity-based political parties and their leaders are with the advancement of their communities. Here, it is important to realise that those who claim to represent their ethnic communities in reality only represent themselves, maximise their self-interest, consolidate their power position and do all they can for their family members. Hence, reservation and political representation systems in Nepal have been grossly exaggerated, manipulated and misused as tools for maximising the self-interest of a few politically and socially influential individuals of a particular ethnic community or regional identity under the guise of collective ethnic identity and solidarity. As a result, identity politics and representation in Nepal reflect the deep structure of our society. It is a feudal privilege given to a few educated and socially influential leaders to carry the burden of liberation for their obedient subjects because they cannot politically speak for themselves. Thus, identity politics and representation in Nepal have become a mere elitist project and a struggle of privilege between so-called “privileged communities” and “privileged” people claiming to represent underprivileged communities or ethnicities.",political

However, today, everyone knows  that it is failing .  It has been nine years since there has  not been a regional SAARC summit , which indicates the failure of SAARC.

Alternative politics in Nepal: Contributions to state accountability-public responsibility balance,"Over the past decades, the country experienced a tumultuous transition to democracy. The  Maoist insurgency  and the  end of the monarchy  established a democratic republic of Nepal. Despite holding several rounds of elections and promulgating a new constitution, Nepal has struggled to establish a stable and functional democratic system. While corruption is rife, political parties and leaders have been accused of using dirty tactics to gain and maintain power, including vote-buying, intimidation and violence. It means the status of state accountability in Nepal is poor whereas the public can also be held responsible for flagging the avoidance of responsibility. In general, the state has a responsibility to be accountable to the public and the public has a responsibility to hold the state accountable. This accountability is critical to ensuring that the state is fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. The public response to the state is crucial for the functioning of a healthy  democracy , which is the democratic process. But as the state accountability-public responsibility balance is poor in Nepal, various alternative political forces have now promised to change the scenario. Their logic seems valid as  alternative politics can  take the country to a new level of state accountability.  State accountability to the public The state is accountable to the public in various ways such as by providing access to information, ensuring transparency along with being responsive to public needs and concerns. The  constitution of Nepal  guarantees the right to information and a separate act has been enacted to ensure citizens’ access to information. However, there is a need to strengthen state accountability. To do so, the following things should be considered: In Nepal,  corruption and inefficiency  in the public sector are significant challenges that prevent state accountability, hence it should be addressed first. Public responsibility Citizens have a responsibility to participate in the democratic process and contribute to state accountability. This responsibility includes voting in elections, engaging in civic education, participating in public debates and holding elected officials accountable for their actions. The following things should be considered for strengthening the public’s responsibility: Alternative politics and state accountability  In Nepal, alternative politics has to play a critical role in advocating for the rights of marginalised communities, promoting transparency and accountability in governance and advocating for democratic reforms. Alternative politics can play a role in exposing these issues and advocating for reforms to promote transparency, state accountability, responsibility and efficiency in the public sector. It needs to be actively involved in promoting civic engagement and empowering citizens to participate in the democratic process. This can be achieved through grassroots organising, community mobilisation, and advocacy for policy changes that promote citizen participation. Thus, state accountability and public responsibility are critical for the functioning of a healthy democracy. Alternative politics can play a vital role in promoting these concepts by advocating for reforms that promote transparency, accountability and citizen participation. Alternative political parties can provide a platform for citizens to engage in the democratic process, voice their concerns and hold the state accountable. It can also offer new ideas and solutions to the challenges faced by the state and the public. By promoting accountability and responsibility, alternative politics can contribute to the development of a stronger and more effective democracy in Nepal.",political

Courts in Nepal have a growing backlog of unheard cases. What can be the solutions?,"The judicial system is the cornerstone of any democratic society, which provides a mechanism for individuals to seek justice and resolve disputes. It is a crucial aspect of the legal framework of a country. It ensures that citizens receive fair and timely justice. It means for a democracy to survive and thrive here, courts in Nepal should be functioning smoothly. However, they are hit by a problem that is growing bigger every day: a backlog of unheard cases.  The backlog of cases is causing significant delays in resolving disputes at almost all courts in Nepal. It is obvious that the problem is detrimental to access to justice for many individuals. The situation is further  complicated by the Covid pandemic , which has resulted in significant delays in court proceedings, leading to an even greater backlog of unheard cases. Hence, it is imperative that the country’s judicial system immediately think of solutions to help courts in Nepal get out of this perpetual problem.  Causes and consequences The reasons for the backlog of cases at courts in Nepal are complex and varied. Sometimes, it is due to a lack of resources, such as funding and staffing. In other cases, it is due to the increasing complexity of cases and the growing demands on the court system. Whatever the cause is, the result is the same. Individuals are waiting for years to have their cases heard whereas many cases are not being heard at all. The impact of this backlog is far-reaching and damaging.  For individuals who are waiting for their cases to be heard, it can lead to significant financial and emotional stress, as well as a sense of hopelessness and frustration. In some cases, it can also lead to the loss of business or a home, or even the loss of custody of a child.   The longer the wait, the greater its impact on the individual. It is similar to the saying that justice delayed is justice denied. According to the data collected by Advocate Deepak Raj Joshi after filing a right-to-information application to the  Supreme Court , the court’s constitutional bench received 669 writ petitions until February 12, 2023, since the establishment of the bench in 2015. But, in the period, only 421 petitions have been resolved. It is apparent that the Supreme Court in general (besides the constitutional bench), as well as other  high and district courts  in Nepal, is not in a better position.  The solutions To address the growing problem of unheard cases at courts in Nepal, the government, civil society organisations and the media should work together to find a solution. As per the constitution, the Supreme Court can have 20 justices in addition to the chief justice. But, currently, there are five positions vacant. While the stipulated number (20) besides the chief justice is not sufficient, keeping the positions vacant is not helping the case.  The government is not serious about appointing additional justices and judges. Meanwhile, the courts in Nepal are underfunded and understaffed, which needs to be addressed first. Nepal can follow the practice of the United States of America, which has implemented several measures to reduce the number of unheard cases in its court system. One such measure is the introduction of pre-trial diversion programmes, where low-level offenders are given the opportunity to undergo rehabilitation programmes instead of going through the court system. This has not only reduced the number of cases in the court system but also helped to reduce the rate of recidivism. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the government has introduced a number of initiatives to reduce the backlog of cases. One of the most successful initiatives has been the use of alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation and arbitration.  These methods help to resolve disputes between parties without the need for a formal court hearing. This has not only reduced the number of cases in the court system but also helped to reduce the cost and time associated with traditional court proceedings.  Likewise, in India, the government has introduced an e-court, which allows for the electronic filing and management of cases. This has helped streamline the court system and reduce the backlog of cases. The use of technology has also made the court system more accessible to citizens, particularly those in remote areas.  So it is time for courts in Nepal to take a cue from these countries and find their own way to solve this problem. Besides the initiatives mentioned above, training programmes should be introduced to equip the staff at courts in Nepal with the skills and knowledge necessary to manage cases effectively. Additionally, it is important to raise awareness of the issue and engage the public in finding solutions as this will help build public support for reforms and encourage greater accountability. Failure to address this issue may lead to increased public dissatisfaction and a significant negative impact on the reputation of Nepal’s judicial system. The key is to adopt innovative and effective methods that can help to streamline the process and deliver justice to citizens in a timely and efficient manner.",political
Swarnim Wagle says he has left Nepali Congress,"Kathmandu, March 30 Economist Swarnim Wagle has told  Nepali Congress  leaders he is no longer a member of the party. Wagle said he left Nepali Congress because party president Sher Bahadur Deuba ran the party as his family. Sources say he informed Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Biswa Prakash Sharma and senior leaders Shekhar Koirala and Govinda Raj Pokharel about his decision to leave the party. “I will not be part of Sher Bahadur and Arzu-led party,” he told the leaders via text message. As reported, he has said he could rejoin the party if any of the four leaders would ever lead the Nepali Congress. Wagle’s statement comes at a time when Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party is claiming it will field Wagle in Tanahun 1 for the  April 23 by-election . As a member of the Congress party, the renowned economist expressed his  willingness to contest the general elections in November 2022 . But Deuba denied the nomination.

Federalism at stake? Nepal’s provincial governments submit themselves to the federal power games,"Provincial governments in Nepal are changing one after another. Bagmati Chief Minister Shalik Ram Jamkattel  received a vote of confidence  on March 24 after the CPN-UML withdrew its support extended to him. For international observers, this might sound strange as the UML proposed him for the chief minister just two and a half months ago. But, for Nepalis, this is just a regular affair as the country’s provincial governments have not been able to function autonomously so far. Accordingly, chief ministers of Gandaki and Lumbini–Khaga Raj Adhikari and Leela Giri–are going through  the same fate  in the next few weeks. The CPN-UML leaders’ chief ministership is at stake with the Maoist Centre not supporting them. Whenever political equations change at the federal level, the most immediate authorities to receive the shockwaves are provincial governments. Hence, as soon as the CPN-Maoist Centre  broke away from the CPN-UML coalition  in the run-up to the presidential election last month, most provincial governments–formed by the constituents of the federal-level ruling coalition–were certain to receive hits. Observers and stakeholders say this practice has jeopardised the spirit of federalism that  the 2015 constitution  envisioned, giving birth–albeit on paper–to the autonomously functioning legislative and executive bodies at the provincial level.  Autonomy snatched away  On March 5, Sudurpaschim province chief Kamal Bahadur  Shah received a vote of confidence  to ensure that his government formed last month will last longer. Among the major parties to trust him was the Maoist Centre. But until a few hours before that, the Maoist party was adamant that it would not support the Nepali Congress leader unless there was a written agreement on power sharing. But soon they were helpless to submit themselves to the party’s central chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s directive. In fact, they were in a position to vote for Shah only after the written agreement. But later, following the command of the central committee of the CPN Maoist Centre, the parliamentarian of the CPN Maoist Centre of Sudurpaschim, agreeing on an oral agreement, gave a vote of confidence to Shah.   “Following the instruction of the central committee, we gave a vote of confidence to Shah,” said Khag Raj Bhatta, the parliamentary party leader of the CPN-Maoist Centre. “The power-sharing among the alliance will also be determined according to the agreement held at the central level.” Reportedly , the provincial assembly members who came to Kathmandu for the presidential and vice presidential elections earlier this month were simultaneously busy lobbying with their parties’ central leadership to nominate them for chief ministers and ministers. It is apparent that it is the federal leaders, not the provincial lawmakers, who make the governments.  Against the constitution Political analyst Jagat Nepal says this practice is against the spirit of federalism as per the constitution.  “In federalism, the provincial government is supposed to be autonomous. But in Nepal, things are different, ” Nepal says, “Here, the structure of the central government determines the structure of the provincial governments.” Nepal says the central leadership should be held responsible for this trend more than the provincial leaders. “Those in the central committee are reluctant to grant autonomy to their provincial bodies and provincial governments in order to maintain their grip.”  Rudra Sharma, a federalism expert, also says that the concept of federalism is wrongly being practised in the country.  “Federalism is just a political concept here in Nepal; it hasn’t been a part of the administration and economics of the country,” says Sharma. “Due to that, our leaders are failing to understand its spirit.”  The inability to prepare the Staff Adjustment Bill to date also shows that federalism has not been a part of the nation’s administration, he says, adding there is no way provincial governments can function autonomously anytime soon.  Both Nepal and Sharma believe that once federalism becomes a part of the administration and economy, not only politics, expected changes can be seen in the country. “But it is certain to take a long time here in Nepal,” says Nepal.  Sharma says there are certain areas–such as national security and foreign affairs–in which federal governments can control the autonomy of provincial governments. “But the way Nepal’s central power is ruling the provinces–to control each and every movement–is inappropriate.”",political

Why is a better economy essential for Nepal’s national security in the new age?,"National security and the economy are inexorably interlinked and have almost a symbiotic relationship with each other. While national security makes our country safer, economic security will make our country better in terms of improving day to day lives of ordinary people. So, a better economy also makes a country safe. This is especially true in the context of a globalised 21st century marked by accelerated economic integration and the digital revolution. The global context When we talk about national security and the economy, it is important to first outline the key developments in the global framework. The 21st century is a radically different world than what we experienced in the last century. Globalisation combined with information technology has made us economically highly interconnected like never before in the past. What is also distinct about our time is the pace of change which is super-fast. This has brought both opportunities and challenges for the countries like Nepal which is at the margins of the global economy and power. On the one hand, we can smartly take advantage of globalisation to connect more with the world and explore newer opportunities for trade and investment. On the other hand, economically constrained countries like Nepal are vulnerable to possible economic shocks, energy crises, and disruption of global supply chains at the international level. There are new security threats such as cyberattacks as evidenced by the recent incident at our Tribhuvan International Airport when its server was attacked. There are also risks of data espionage and disinformation. More importantly, Nepal is vulnerable to the adverse  effects of accelerating climate change .  Snow melting ,  droughts and floods  have already generated insecurities for a large section of our population. Again, these risks have a direct connection with our economy. If we have a better economy, we will be able to deal with these threats more effectively. National security in the new age A question that has become most pertinent in the 21st century is: what is national security? In the last centuries, national security was defined mainly in military terms. As per this state-centric paradigm, the protection of a state’s territorial integrity is of core importance. This still remains imperative as shown by the Russian attacks against Ukraine. There is a risk that big countries can launch military aggression against weaker neighbours for their larger interests. However, the narrow definition of national security in terms of territorial defence is not adequate for this globalised, new digital age. Particularly after the post-Cold War, there have been new debates on security. Security scholars and experts have broadened the scope of security to better account for globalisation and wider trends following the end of the bipolar struggle for power. More importantly, the threats of climate change that have become urgent in this Anthropocene era have pushed us to broaden the scope of national security. Our natural environment does not recognise territorial borders. As the global temperature rises, it is having an impact on Nepal as in other countries. Many of these aspects focus less on the state and on military threats and more on human-centric threats and risks – expanding to include areas such as economic security, health, technological and environmental concerns. Hence, national security has become associated with preventing disruptive effects on society, economic performance or critical processes. Encompassing economy In turn, the paradigm of national security has broadened to encompass human security as its core dimension. An important pillar of human security is economic security. Economic security safeguards ordinary people from basic insecurities such as hunger, disease and unemployment, directly related to their physical security. Economic security is also crucial to ensure technological security. Only when we have economic resources, we can deal with the newly emerged digital threats and risks of this new century. Recognising these new security perspectives,  Nepal’s new constitution  has guaranteed an all-around human security system. The National Security Policy 2016 also reflects a few aspects of this new model of national security. However, national security strategies need continuous critical thinking and discussions to address the constantly evolving threats and risks of our new age.  When we are talking about updating our national security policies and strategies, we also need to have a perspective on the evolving global power dynamics. International relations have rapidly changed in the last two decades. The end of the Cold War and the end of the bipolar world have briefly transformed the world into a predominantly unipolar one, which is now gradually changing into a multipolar one. The roles of not only the great powers but also medium-sized states like Nepal are undergoing changes. It has been predicted that in the next few decades, China and India will become two of the world’s superpowers. During that time, Asia will surpass the combined strength of North America and Europe in economic might, population size, and military spending. India and China will have vetoes over many international decisions, from climate change to global trade, human rights, and business standards. This is a sure challenge to the US’s sole hegemony after the Cold War which the US understandably wants to maintain. Not surprisingly, there have been shifts in the US policy towards China from the Obama administration’s earlier relatively friendly approach. Since Trump’s administration, China has been perceived as the most significant threat to its unilateral global dominance. Biden administration has continued this policy. This has led to an increased rise in global military spending particularly in the US, China, and India and the use of economics as a tool of national security. However, the US is not in a position to confront China completely due to its economic implications. The US is China’s largest trading partner. The US policy towards India has also evolved. In recent years, the US has been cosying up with India and treats it as an important ally to counter China’s increasing global influence. Nevertheless, their relationship is not straightforward due to India’s historically close links with Russia and US’s military engagement with Pakistan. It is also said that an influential section in the US is concerned about India’s internal political developments, particularly human rights abuses of minority groups. China and India’s relationship is equally complex. While both countries understand that mutual cooperation is in their long-term interests and deep economic linkages, there are underlying insecurities and border disputes that often shape their relationship. These complexities of relationships have been manifested in newly emerged global alliances. On the one hand, India and China got together to form BRIC in 2009 which later was renamed BRICS. On the other, India has been a part of the recently formed QUAD to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Nepal amid the centrality of the Indo-Pacific region This Indo-Pacific region has become geopolitically important because there is intense competition between two great powers –the US and China. It is said that the Indo-Pacific which is home to 65 per cent of the world’s population will shape the trajectory of global politics for most of the 21st century. We have seen a few glimpses of Indo-Pacific geo-political rivalry in Nepal as well. While the US is building alliances to counter China, China has its own initiatives to extend its global influence such as Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which is joined by around 18 countries from the European Union. What is also distinct about these current international coalitions is that instead of long-term alliances such as NATO, they are ad hoc project-based alliances. A few scholars also claim that we are moving towards a post-Alliance era in which ad hoc international coalitions would be dominant. Nepal’s strategic position between two nuclear powers competing for global powers has created new complexities for us when it comes to safeguarding our sovereignty and national security, which is vital for economic progress. The competition and insecurities between three global power centres of the 21st century, namely western powers, China and India have affected our national security framework. The challenge for Nepal is while we need to engage with all three powers for our economic benefit, we need to stay away from their competition for power and influence with each other. Oftentimes, economic benefits are tied up with their security interests. This is when it gets complicated for Nepal. Given our vulnerabilities, economic security has to be an integral part of our national security. I fully subscribe to the idea that there should be an emphasis on trade diversification and a self-reliant economy as the pillar of our national security. While it may not be possible to be fully self-reliant in all sectors in today’s day and age, we have the potential to be self-reliant at least on food and energy security. We can take the example of the West. After the Ukraine war, it started taking initiatives to reduce its dependence on Russia for its energy needs. It is also taking steps to reduce dependence on China for strategic goods such as computer chips. It needs to be stressed that political parties need a better vision of Nepal’s security and defence policies. Merely displaying their commitment to protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity is not adequate. We need to think more deeply about national security issues at least keeping a long-term perspective in mind. The next road In terms of long-term strategic planning on national security, according to international security experts, two key global security threats need to be taken into account. The first relates to massively increasing income gaps that could trigger violent conflicts in the margins of our society. The second relates to environmental degradation that is likely to cause violent conflicts in countries like Nepal in the future. It is now high time that the country embarks upon the modernisation of the Nepal Army to suit the demands of the fast-changing geo-political/geo-strategic situation in the neighbourhood in the 21st century. It would be prudent to equip the Army with ultra-modern weapons and techniques and focus on quality rather than quantity. We could think of raising a mass militia trained in guerilla warfare and mountain warfare to support the armed forces in case of external aggression. Also, we must find a way to regulate the open and porous borders with the big neighbours. We need to remember that the Maoist’s movement for inclusive democracy and social justice in Nepal as well as our peace process were home-grown. Both Nepal Army and the Maoists should realise that we both want a prosperous Nepal in which our children and grandchildren have a bright future. Therefore, we should leave the past behind and focus on building an economically prosperous Nepal that we all can be proud of and want our future generations to happily live in.",political
Prem Shahi arrest and release leave questions about justice within Nepal Army unanswered,"On December 19, 2022, Major General Prem Shahi was given a letter of retirement by the  Nepal Army . But, dissatisfied with the decision, he went to the  Supreme Court  arguing he was forced to retire illegitimately. The court issued an interim order in his favour.  But when he went to the office with the interim order, he was arrested, on January 3, 2023. On March 2, he got out after spending 59 days in custody of the Military Police after the Supreme Court issued an interim order to release him. But why was Prem Shahi arrested? What wrong did he do that he was forced to retire and put into custody for two months? And why did the Nepal Army not allow Shahi to work despite the Supreme Court issuing an interim order asking he is reinstated? While some questions can be easily answered, many of the related questions are still unanswered.  Why was he arrested? Prem Shahi was arrested on charges of financial irregularities but was later charged with mutiny, disciplinary breach and damage to property. However, the Army Headquarters, which had charged him with a serious offence like mutiny, did not take strict action. He was accused of financial irregularities and put an end to the case. “People get charged with life sentences for mutiny. Is a court marshal for financial irregularities enough for such a crime?” questions a former high-ranking army official. The Summary General Military Court did not want to announce the verdict on this case. But after the Supreme Court summoned Colonel Mahendra Jung Shah and Lieutenant Colonel Kuldip Timisina, the military court had to announce that Shahi had been relieved from his duties.  Sources say Prem Shahi’s family was pressured not to file a writ petition at the Supreme Court.  On March 1, Shah and Timisina were asked to be present at the Pashupati room of the Tribhuvan Army Officers Club in the Army Headquarters for the trial of the case, in which they were accused of mutiny. Mentioning that a Summary General Military Court had been formed under the chairmanship of Tara Dhwaj Pandey, they were asked to be present for the trial. But as soon as they appeared, Shah and Timsina were arrested. Following that, Lieutenant Colonel Timsina submitted an application asking for copies of all the documents and evidence related to the case, saying that a case related to mutiny had been filed against them even though they were being questioned about another matter. He had also put in the petition that he should have been able to defend himself through a legal practitioner of his choice according to the right in the constitution. However, it is mentioned in the writ petition filed at the Supreme Court that the army sent him to prison without even giving him that right. He claimed that he was not able to give any answer and defend himself against the charges against him. Why and how was he released? While hearing the petition, the bench of Supreme Court Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal on March 1 ordered both of them to appear with certified copies of the main documents of the case within three days. As soon as the order to submit those documents came through the Attorney General’s office, the Army Headquarters was shocked. On March 2, an employee of the court and a relative went to Army Headquarters to deliver a court order. However, the Army Headquarters refused to register the order. From 10 am to 5 pm, employees and relatives waited outside the gates of Army Headquarters and left home disappointed. A lawyer who went inside was escorted out by a team of military police. According to Binod Karki, the former treasurer of the Supreme Court Bar Association, it is contempt of the court for any state body not to comply with the deadline for the order of the Supreme Court or any other court. “When the prime minister or the president doesn’t get a pass, neither does the Nepal Army,” says Karki. He says that the army should have replied to the court and stated if the Prem Shahi case had been too sensitive for a civil court. “They can answer by stating the military court will deliver justice. That is their right too, but in this case, they disrespected the Supreme Court and obstructed the justice process,” says Karki. The army did not receive the summons the entire day. Instead, a military officer says a military court order was hurriedly issued to release all of them (three including Prem Shahi) on March 2 amid pressure. There is proof that the military court issued the order in a rush as it was given verbally and not in writing. According to an officer of Army Headquarters, there was a risk that more questions would be raised against the army as soon as the document filed against three officers including Prem Shahi for military mutiny went to the court. “A general and two of his subordinates being indulged in the mutiny was not a small thing. There was a risk that the entire Army Headquarters would become a laughing stock if documents were released to the Supreme Court,” says an official of the Nepal Army. When two people were ordered to appear before the court, Shahi was also released. An officer close to him says the plan was to keep Shahi in custody until the final verdict was made in his age dispute case.  “There was too much pressure to release him so he was released,” says the officer. The officers did not work in the same unit. However, all of them were known as the close officers of former Chief of Army Staff Purna Chandra Thapa. The current military leadership has accused them of doing activities against the current  Chief of Army Staff, Prabhuram Sharma . According to sources close to the current military leadership, Thapa at that time lobbied to extend his tenure. Therefore, officials close to Sharma claim as he was preparing to take over the leadership, Sharma was being watched by Prem Shahi and others. Now with Sharma at the helm, he is retaliating against taking Official’s claim that they are now being retaliated against. What about different birth dates? The issue started when the Army Headquarters sent a letter to Prem Shahi on December 19, 2022, telling him he had reached the retirement age of 58. Following that, Shahi filed a petition at the Supreme Court stating he was being forced to retire based on a wrong birth date. Shahi stated his birth year, according to the documents presented to the army, during recruitment was January 4, 1966. That meant his term increased by a month. The army, however, gave him a letter of retirement based on the character certificate issued by Budhanilkantha School. But in all other government documents, his date of birth is listed as December 24, 1966. Prem Shahi stated that since the character certificate was according to the Gregorian calendar, there was an error while converting it to the Bikram Sambat calendar. Even a department of the Nepal Army had stated there was an error in his date of birth and had recommended using the date of birth mentioned on his citizenship certificate. But then Defence Minister Iswar Pokharel did not uphold the recommendation. Noting this, Justice Phuyal issued a verdict ordering the Nepal army to not force Shahi to retire. Was the arrest okay? Prem Shahi was detained by the military police after the order was issued when he went to meet army chief Sharma, say sources. They say he was detained as he went against the decision of the army. After arresting Shahi, the army also raided his house in Budhanilkatha charging him with financial irregularities. According to a former Nepal Army officer, detaining him as soon as he received an order from the court was a disgraceful act even from a normal point of view. “If he was charged with corruption, why wasn’t he asked to retire? He was initially asked to stay at home but when the court asked the army to revoke his retirement, why did they arrest him,” the officer questions. Interestingly, the army formed a court of inquiry under the leadership of an officer junior to Prem Shahi to investigate him. Baburam Shrestha, who was assigned to lead it, had faced action when Thapa was the chief of army staff. Shrestha’s promotion was withheld for a year after it was found that there was an irregularity in his recruitment process.  A court of inquiry is a team formed to conduct a preliminary investigation into the allegations against a military officer. Based on the report it gives, the chief of the army staff forms a team for a court martial. The Shrestha-led committee recommended action against Shahi for mutiny, violation of military discipline and damage to government property. Before his report was upheld by Sharma, Timsina and Shah were also made defendants. According to military sources, Shah is an officer in line to be promoted to the position of brigadier general. However, according to Karki’s report, the Summary General Military Court has ordered that Shah’s promotion be suspended for two years. After Shah’s promotion was stalled, Om Bahadur Bhatta, a member of the court of inquiry, will be promoted to the position. “All the sequence of events shows the intention behind prosecuting the case”, says an officer. While the release of three officers including Prem Shahi seems like a good thing, at the moment, it has raised some serious questions about Nepal Army and the politics that goes on inside it.

Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists  say  the bill does not fully meet the country’s domestic law or international legal obligations and will not provide justice for victims if adopted in its current form. “The bill will not adequately provide for the effective prosecution of serious crimes under international law,” the organisations say in a statement today, “It should be revised to comply with Nepal’s Supreme Court rulings and international human rights law and standards.” “In addition, the revision process should ensure adequate consultation with conflict victims about the content of the proposed legislation.” “Key provisions of this bill appear to be designed to shield alleged perpetrators from prosecution for some of the most serious crimes under international law,” Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for South Asia, is quoted in the statement. “If it is rushed through parliament without significant changes, it cannot be the basis for a process that has the support of conflict victims, nor legal credibility at home or abroad.” The government recently  drafted the bill and registered it in the parliament  as concerns about  transitional justice issues are coming to the fore  once again.",political
Man injured during protest against Koshi province name dies during treatment,"Biratnagar, March 24 A man who was baton-charged by the riot police during a demonstration against Nepal’s easternmost province being named Koshi died during treatment on Friday.

Why does Nepal need an advocate protection law asap?,"Advocates play a critical role in ensuring access to justice for all citizens. They represent people from all walks of life, from the poorest to the richest, and help them navigate the complex legal system.  Legal professionals in Nepal play a crucial role in upholding justice but they often face significant obstacles in their work.  To address this issue, the Bar Council of India released a draft of the  Advocates (Protection) Bill , 2021, on July 2, 2021. Introducing a similar advocate protection law would be a significant step forward for Nepal’s legal system. The crucial need An advocate protection law would not only provide much-needed protection to advocates but also boost public confidence in the justice system. When people feel that their lawyers are safe and protected, they are more likely to approach them for help with their legal problems. The proposed advocate protection law seeks to address these issues by providing a framework for the protection of advocates. It will include measures such as creating a special fund for the welfare of advocates, providing security to advocates at risk, and ensuring the prosecution of those who commit crimes against advocates. Furthermore, the law will address other concerns of advocates, such as professional ethics, by establishing a mechanism for disciplinary action against advocates who violate ethical norms. In recent years, several cases of attacks on lawyers have been reported, including assault, abduction, and even murder. These incidents not only pose a threat to individual advocates but also undermine the rule of law and the justice system as a whole.  Introducing the advocate protection law in Nepal will send a strong message that the country is committed to protecting the rights of legal professionals and ensuring the rule of law. It would also encourage more people to take up the legal profession, knowing that they have the necessary protections in place. Furthermore, the law would help to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and the legal profession. When lawyers are able to work without fear of intimidation or violence, they can better serve their clients and uphold justice. Challenges ahead However, there may be several challenges that the government and legal community may face in implementing an advocate protection law. One of the main challenges could be the lack of political will to pass the bill from the parliament. While the introduction of such a law is essential, lawmakers may prioritise other issues, and the bill may not be given the necessary attention or support it deserves.   Another challenge could be the lack of resources to implement the law. The law proposes the creation of a special fund for the welfare of advocates. However, it remains to be seen whether the government will allocate sufficient funds for this purpose. Additionally, the law may face opposition from those who feel that it gives undue protection to lawyers, potentially hindering the pursuit of justice in certain cases.  There may also be issues with implementing the provisions of the advocate protection law. For example, ensuring the security of lawyers who face threats or attacks may require a significant investment in security personnel and infrastructure. Similarly, setting up special courts to deal with cases related to attacks on lawyers may require extensive training and resources for judges and other court personnel.  Moreover, the bill may not adequately address the underlying causes of attacks on lawyers, such as corruption and political interference in the justice system. Addressing these issues would require broader reforms in the legal and political systems, which may be challenging to implement. Solutions Several solutions can be considered to address the challenges that may arise with the introduction of an advocate protection law in Nepal.  Firstly, there needs to be a concerted effort by lawmakers to prioritise the passage of the bill. This can be achieved by building a coalition of support from legal professionals, civil society groups, and political leaders who understand the importance of protecting lawyers and promoting  access to justice . Secondly, sufficient resources should be allocated to implement the provisions of the law. This could involve a collaboration between the government, legal community, and civil society organisations to establish a fund for the welfare of advocates and provide the necessary infrastructure and training for the implementation of the advocate protection law. Thirdly, the bill should be drafted in a way that strikes a balance between protecting lawyers and upholding the rule of law. This can be achieved by ensuring that the provisions of the law are not overly broad and do not impede the pursuit of justice in some instances. Fourthly, broader reforms should be implemented to address the underlying causes of attacks on lawyers, such as corruption and political interference in the justice system. This could involve reforms to the legal and political systems that promote transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. Overall, Nepal urgently needs an advocate protection law and the parliament should introduce it without delay. This law will not only ensure the safety and welfare of advocates but also strengthen the rule of law and promote access to justice for all citizens. By introducing such a bill, the parliament can demonstrate its commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of its citizens with special privileges for legal professionals in Nepal.",political

"Govt giving Rs 200,000 to each ‘disqualified’ Maoist fighter as relief","Kathmandu, March 22 The government is preparing to give Rs 200,000 to each of the Maoist fighters who were certified as ‘disqualified’ for army integration as a part of  the peace process . A cabinet meeting held on Monday made a decision in this regard, and the  Ministry of Home Affairs  is preparing to formulate a standard operating procedure for that, informs Home Secretary Binod Prasad Singh. The move comes at a time when the government is under fire for  failing to take the transitional justice process forward . As per the  Comprehensive Peace Accord, 2006 , a UN mission, popularly known as UNMIN, was called to facilitate the army integration process. The UN mission had disqualified 4,009 of the 19,602 Maoist fighters for integration into the Nepal Army.  Of the qualified fighters, around 1,400 joined the national army organisation whereas the rest went for a voluntary exit scheme. Those choosing the exit were also given money as a relief.",political
Contemporary Nepali politics is full of drama. What does it suggest about the future?,"The political events of recent times in Nepal are as twisted as thriller novels or web series you watch on Netflix. If you miss out on following the updates daily, you will surely lose track of activities going on in the nation. Nepali politics has always been eventful but it seems it has never been so dramatic. It is well-known to everyone that Nepali politics is characterised by feuds, instability and intrusion from outsiders. Pushpa Kamal Dahal , the head of the CPN-Maoist Centre and the current prime minister, was on good terms with KP Oli until recently. The coalition they formed was to lead for the next five years only if Dahal had not untied the knots that bound them together. Before the elections in November 2022, the Nepali Congress, the CPN-Maoist Centre, and other parties had formed a coalition to outweigh the CPN-UML. However, after the elections, Dahal broke the ties with Nepali Congress and embraced CPN-UML, leaving the Nepali Congress in a daze. And just as Oli thought Dahal stood by his side, Dahal deceived Oli. As a result, the pre-election duos are together once again. Soon the CPN- UML pulled itself out of the government , and now it stands as a major opposition. So what do all these dramatic incidents suggest in the long run? Experiencing deja vu The inconsistency of Dahal has left everyone interested in Nepali politics baffled. People have taken on social media yelling that he is no different than a chameleon that changes its skin colour every now and then. Erratic moves of Dahal have consequently impacted the presidential election as Ram Chandra Paudel of the Nepali Congress garnered 33, 802 votes to  defeat Subas Chandra Nembang  of the CPN-UML. It will be interesting to see where the nation heads under the presidency of Ram Chandra Paudel, who was not considered a lucky figure in Nepali politics. His decades-long career in politics will likely end on a happy note. Despite the uncertainties, one thing is certain: the political heavyweights– Pushpa Kamal Dahal, KP Sharma Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba, Madhav Kumar Nepal– will linger around the political landscapes for some more years. In all probability, they will dominate the next five to 10 years of Nepali politics, and the public will experience deja vu over the years. The scene will continue: the one pulling the legs of another to bask in power. The new forces The 2022 election results fleshed out the public frustration as a newly formed party called the  Rastriya Swatantra Party saw positive outcomes . Of late, youths and even elder people are inclined towards RSP. However, it is important to understand that it is merely frustration that led them to support the RSP. Experts say that  RSP lacks concrete ideology  and that the lousy performance of the old parties has benefitted this new party. Its significance in Nepali politics will be determined in the coming years, as it is too early to comment on RSP’s performance. The elections brought many young politicians into the spotlight of Nepali politics. But, sadly, their behaviour suggests that they are nothing different from their predecessors. In the interviews on the TV stations, they vent out wrath as if they were elected for that. All they do is criticise the old leaders and collect publicity. The public is so frustrated that if someone hurls abuse at old leaders, they happily clap their hands without a second thought. The problem is not only the politicians but the general public too. Nepali society is emotional and a small incident is enough to trigger consciousness. As a citizen, it is important to judge politicians without favour so that the right candidate is elected the next time. A few months before the elections, a campaign called  No, Not Again  caught everyone off guard and it had been said that the nation would vote for change. But now we can see that it is the same again– the heavyweights fighting against each other with young candidates left behind. The essence of change To everyone’s surprise, Baburam Bhattarai did not contest the elections as he sacrificed his den to his old comrade, Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Thanks to Bhattarai, Dahal is the prime minister now.   Bhattarai and his qualification remain isolated as the country plunges into an economic crisis. Nepali politics witnesses a qualified finance minister once in a blue moon, and who knows how many years will pass until the country sees a finance minister as qualified as  Baburam Bhattarai ? As you cast a light on the economy, you are reminded of Swarnim Wagle, an economist to whom the Nepali  Congress did not offer an election ticket . If the Nepali Congress believed he was not good enough, who are you to comment on their decision? The point is that the nation must have a strong finance minister with sound knowledge of the economy. And unless the nation gets a vigorous finance minister, it is impossible to salvage the economy. As activities in Nepali politics progress, you will see more changes and you can only hope everything changes for good.  As you talk about contemporary politics, you should not miss out on commenting on  Gagan Thapa , an ever-young politician and the hope of many. But the problem is that he is competent in everyone’s eyes except Sher Bahadur Deuba. Thapa has started losing hair on his scalp, but Deuba does not seem to notice it. One major question stands: when will Deuba feel that Thapa has grown enough to take the leadership role in Nepali politics?",political

Rabi Lamichhane passport case: Police say prosecution isn’t necessary,"Kathmandu, March 19 After an investigation of the  charge that Rastriya Swatantra Party chairperson Rabi Lamichhane possessed Nepali and US passports at the same time , thereby breaching the national law, the police say he should not be prosecuted. The Kathmandu District Police Range submitted its report to the  District Government Attorey’s Office  recommending no action be taken about the case as Lamichhane did not have any ill intention behind possessing dual passports.  The leader is accused of obtaining a Nepali passport based on illegitimate Nepali citizenship in 2015 May. From 2015 until he renounced his US citizenship in 2018, he had passports from two countries; Nepal’s law does not allow this. In January, the Supreme Court ruled that Rabi Lamichhane’s old citizenship was cancelled when he migrated to the United States and obtained American citizenship, and he could no more use his old Nepali citizenship certificate. Whereas the verdict had  snatched the powerful deputy prime ministerial position  from Lamichhane, it had been said that  Lamichhane could be barred from contesting any election  if he lost the passport case. “But because he submitted his Nepali passport to the Department of Passports as soon as the Supreme Court ordered that his citizenship was invalid,” a police officer says, “It was found that the documents were not used with any ill intent.” Likewise, the police conclude claims that Lamichhane submitted fake information to obtain the documents cannot be justified. According to the police, his activities could not be said to have violated any law in the particular, hence there was no necessity to prosecute him.",political

What’s next for democracy in Nepal?,"The most popular definition of democracy is the one by  Abraham Lincoln , the 16th president of the United States. “Democracy is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.” Simply, it can be understood that  democracy  is a system of government where the lawmakers are elected by the people among themselves, the theory of separation of power is exercised well and rule of law is prevailing. After the period of renaissance and reformation in the 17th century, the democratic system of governance began to evolve and today, in the 21st century, democracy is the most practised and popular system of governance. Here too, a democratic government exists as mentioned by the  constitution of Nepal,  but people are still not happy with the state of democracy in Nepal. So what is next? Struggles for democracy in Nepal Efforts to establish democracy in Nepal  have not been easy. Even after rooting out the Ranas in 1951, the power struggle continued between King Mahendra and banned political parties here during 30 years of the Panchayat system. The people’s movement that was held in 1990 put an end to the Panchayat system of governance and a new constitution was made. Yet, various problems came out including a  decade-long armed war  that jeopardised democracy in Nepal. Then the  2006 people’s movement  ended the war and overthrew the monarchy, paving the way for the elections of the constituent assembly. The constitution was finally made by the constituent assembly elected by the people and promulgated on September 20, 2015. The country’s democratic dream came true after seven decades of continuous struggle. The new constitution of Nepal ensured democracy in Nepal with the theory of separation of power and rule of law to be followed properly to ensure constitutional supremacy. Article 4 of the constitution mentioned that Nepal is a socialist-oriented state, but the people of Nepal are yet not happy as the country lags way behind in economic prosperity. Democracy in Nepal at present Corruption has become one of the biggest challenges for democracy in Nepal as the country is ranked  110th among 180 countries  as per the latest corruption report from Transparency International.  Similarly, the growth of digital democracy becomes an opportunity as well as a challenge. Undoubtedly, the rising usage of internet services and social media is spreading more awareness, but people are easily provoked and fake news is easily spread. Due to the sadness caused by the failures of democracy in Nepal, people are easily getting provoked. When a person comes on social media and scolds politicians with aggression using fancy words, people easily believe that everything said by that person is true and begins following him/her despite their unknown background. Situations like these are a massive threat to democracy; political parties are responsible for this. For strengthening democracy, the strengthening of democratic institutions is necessary, but democratic institutions including constitutional bodies and judicial bodies are getting weak because of political influences and the unhealthy struggle for power among the parties. Remittance is the pillar of the Nepali economy  for a very long and this does not seem to change very soon. People are compelled to spend the energetic periods of their lifetime working abroad just to provide quality education and mediocre health services to their family members. Is this the socialism our constitution talks about? Is this the socialism that people imagined while participating in revolutions? Is this democracy in Nepal? Way forward Democracy in Nepal needs an overhaul. But, how? First of all, instead of getting into the trap of crony capitalism, the political parties should quickly behave to move the country on the path of socialism to make democracy stronger. The leadership who failed to do so should be replaced as soon as possible.  The same person should be restricted from going into the same position again and again. Democratic institutions should be able to work freely without any influence. As the fault is seen from the party conventions, the adoption of the one person: one post principle can be a game-changer. For instance, if we deprive the party presidents of the executive posts and appoint those persons who are not the position-holders in the party committees, the check and balance will become easy. The party committee can check the government and recall the wrong-doers easily as there is nobody from the party committee in the government. Similarly, when political parties promote entrepreneur cadres instead of full-time cadres, the economic expectation of party cadres from their leaders can be minimised. This can be another significant move in controlling corruption and achieving national prosperity as institutional corruption is common today only to provide an economic advantage to party cadres. Nowadays, when we talk about development, we often hear about the US or Europe. Leaders are even trying to impose their development model here in our country, but we should have our own development model to achieve prosperity and strengthen democracy in Nepal. With less than five per cent of the world’s population, the US consumes 17 per cent of the world’s energy. What happens when India and China, who account for roughly 36 per cent of the world’s population, start adopting the US development model? So, a development model based on small agricultural and cottage industries should be made instead of copying the technology of westerners. This suits our economy and lifestyle. While talking about economic growth and sustainable development, the rational use of natural resources should not be forgotten.",political

Why did SAARC fail the hope for regional cooperation?,"In November 2014, the 18th South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit adopted a 36-point Kathmandu Declaration, entitled  Deeper Integration for Peace and Prosperity , promising necessary cooperation and collaboration among the member states.  As per the announcement, Pakistan was scheduled to host the 19th SAARC summit in November 2016. However, in September 2016, after a terrorist attack on the  Indian Army  brigade headquarters near the town of Uri, Baramulla, Kashmir, which was allegedly conducted by the Jaish-e-Mohammed insurgents, the Indian side decided to boycott the summit. Soon after, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan followed suit and also denied attending the summit. Everyone knows  the summit is not held yet .  On December 8, 1985, the key architects of SAARC passed  its charter  stating the regional body is being established for promoting peace, stability, amity, and progress in the region through strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter and Non-Alignment. But, a  failure to conduct a summit  even in nine years is a sign of the failure of regional cooperation, which paints a bleak picture of the future of the regional bloc. So why did the regional body fail? Here are the major reasons. 1. India-Pakistan conflict The ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan has its root in the partition of British India in 1947 and the formation of separate states. The two countries have a long history of conflict and disputes over several issues such as the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir, disagreements over water resources and control of the Siachen glacier, and the loss of East Pakistan 9as Bangladesh). Additionally, there are allegations of terror connections and fear of Indian domination. Regarding the involvement of global organisations in the Kashmir conflict, India thought that the United Nations, which was dominated by the United States and had a mutual defence agreement with Pakistan, would always support Pakistan. Therefore, since the 1960s, India has not accepted the UN’s decision to have an international vote on the issue. The truth is that the SAARC’s future is closely tied to the gravity of conflict and cooperation between India and Pakistan. The ongoing rivalry between India and Pakistan should not be the reason for the failure of an organisation that has a nearly 38-year history. 2. The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 had a significant impact on the SAARC and the region as a whole. The other members of SAARC did not recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which consequentially  delayed the appointment of the SAARC secretary-general .  The rise of the Taliban has had a significant impact on the security and stability of South Asia. The Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islamic law, human rights abuses, and harbouring of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida, were major concerns for many of the countries in South Asia.  Additionally, the Taliban’s close relationship with Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies led to increased tensions between Pakistan and its neighbours, particularly India. The instability in Afghanistan also led to increased tensions between Pakistan and India as both countries accused the other of supporting the Taliban. Furthermore, the Taliban’s control of Afghanistan allowed it to become a major transit point for the illegal drug trade, which had a negative impact on the region’s collective security and long-term stability. This is one of the primary causes of the nine-year inactivity of the SAARC. 3. The Tamil issues in Sri Lanka The long ethnic conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil minority has had a significant impact on the SAARC. The conflict, which began in the 1970s, has resulted in widespread human rights abuses and has led to the displacement of thousands of Tamils from their homes. The government’s military operations against the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in the 1990s led to a large number of civilian casualties and created a humanitarian crisis. The conflict has had a negative impact on regional stability and security, as it has led to increased tensions between Sri Lanka and other SAARC member states, particularly India. The Indian government has been involved in the peace process and has provided humanitarian assistance to the Tamils, which has led to increased tensions with the Sri Lankan government. The conflict has also had a negative impact on the economy of Sri Lanka and the region as a whole. 4. Sri Lanka’s economic crisis Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has had a significant impact on SAARC and the region as a whole. The country has been facing a severe economic crisis since 2018, which has been characterised by high levels of debt, inflation, and a balance of payments crisis. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has led to a decrease in regional trade and investment, as the country is a major player in the South Asian economy. This has had a negative impact on the economies of other SAARC member states, particularly those that have close economic ties with Sri Lanka such as India and Bangladesh.  Overall, Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has had a negative impact on the economies of other SAARC member states and on regional stability and security. What next? What went wrong with SAARC while similar regional formations such as the EU, BIMSTEC, and ASEAN are successful elsewhere seems very important to understand. Some SAARC member countries have continued to work on regional cooperation through other initiatives and forums such as BIMSTEC. But what we need to understand is SAARC is not formed just because of geographical contiguity and shared cultures; the region also has common aspirations and joint challenges to face for ensuring a secure and quality life and then seeking the rightful place for one-fifth of humanity in the contemporary world. The failures of the individual leaders of a member state should not be taken as the complete failures of the body of SAARC. No country, bigger or smaller, can achieve solid success in this interconnected world as the country’s geo-economic prospects are influenced by regional dynamics and spatial considerations.  The SAARC countries need stronger institutions and legal frameworks to ensure that government actions are open to public inspection. SAARC is technically still alive, but it has been largely inactive and facing multiple challenges. It is uncertain if the organisation will be able to overcome these challenges and revive its role as a regional forum in the future. As the current chair of SAARC, Nepal bears the responsibility of determining how to revitalise the organisation.",political
Why does Nepal’s election system need the right to recall and the right to reject?,"The right to recall  and  the right to reject  are two important provisions that aim to ensure greater transparency and accountability in any country’s democratic process. But, sadly, Nepal lacks them. These provisions provide citizens with the power to hold their elected representatives accountable and play an active role in shaping the country’s political landscape. After all, democracy is all about the power of the people. As of now, in countries like Nepal, the power of the people is often limited to the right to vote once every few years. In such a scenario, the concept of the right to recall and reject is gaining momentum as an important tool for holding elected  representatives accountable . Yet, the right to recall and the right to reject are not silver bullets that will magically transform the political scenario overnight. Instead, they are tools that citizens can use to hold their representatives accountable and bring about systemic changes in the political culture of other countries including Nepal. The need The right to recall and the right to reject are important in today’s election system as these tools provide greater power to citizens and promote transparency and accountability in governance.  The right to recall allows citizens to remove elected officials from office before their term expires if they are not fulfilling their duties or are involved in corruption or malpractices. This gives citizens a greater say in the political process and encourages elected officials to act in the best interests of their constituents. The right to reject allows citizens to reject all candidates if they feel that none of them is suitable for the position. This sends a message to political parties and candidates that they need to work harder to gain the trust of the public. It also encourages political parties to field qualified and competent candidates, improving the quality of democracy in Nepal. The implementation of these tools can help the country reduce corruption and promote fair elections. The fear of being recalled or rejected can deter corrupt politicians from running for office or encourage them to clean up their acts. This can help the country ensure that only honest and qualified individuals are elected to represent the citizens of Nepal. Existing challenges for full implementation But every provision and law faces challenges in the introductory phases, so the implementation of the right to recall and the right to reject in Nepal’s election system could face several challenges. One of the major challenges is a lack of awareness among citizens about their rights and how they work, which eventually leads to the failure of effective use of these rights as tools to hold elected officials accountable. In the meantime, there is a risk that these rights could be misused by political parties or groups to fulfil their vested interests and used as a political weapon to target elected officials from opposing parties. Implementation of these rights is a challenge on its own. It is challenging in terms of using technologies such as the development of a proper mechanism for recall elections and rejection of candidates and ensuring that the process is fair, transparent, and efficient. Moreover, there might be resistance from elected officials as they might feel threatened by the implementation of these tools. The solution To overcome the challenges that may arise with the implementation of the right to recall and the right to reject in Nepal’s election system, several solutions can be considered, such as: The right to recall and the right to reject are important provisions that can help promote greater accountability and transparency in Nepal’s political system. By empowering citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable, these provisions can help strengthen the country’s democracy and promote greater trust between the people and their leaders. It is essential that citizens, political parties, and civil society organisations work together to ensure that these provisions are effectively implemented and that citizens are aware of their rights and can exercise them freely. The right to recall and the right to reject are crucial provisions that have the potential to transform the democratic framework of Nepal. However, their success depends on the active participation of citizens and the willingness of political leaders to implement them effectively. It is time for Nepali citizens to embrace these provisions and use them to bring about positive changes in the political system of Nepal.",political

Vice presidential election: UML fields Asta Laxmi Shakya as the ruling alliance prepares multiple nominations,"Kathmandu, March 11 The newly formed ruling alliance that  got successful in the Nepal presidential election  has remained divided about its vice presidential election candidate as of the day of filing nominations today.

Instead, they have decided to field at least three candidates–including Ram Sahaya Yadav of the Janata Samjbadi Party Nepal and Mamata Jha of the Janamat Party–for the same position and continue efforts to forge a deal by the election date. It is likely a third candidate will be a woman from the JSPN.  Although the alliance had already decided to support the JSPN candidate previously, it could not root for Yadav now considering demands from the Election Commission officials among others that a  vice presidential election candidate should be other than men .

Alternative politics in Nepal: Opportunities and challenges,"Alternative politics refers to the emergence of new political forces that challenge traditional power structures and offer alternative visions of governance. In Nepal, alternative politics has been gaining traction in recent years, especially among the younger generation. The  Maoist insurgency  in the early 2000s marked a significant shift in Nepal’s political landscape, leading to the  overthrow of the monarchy  and the establishment of a republic. However, the political parties that emerged after the insurgency failed to address the underlying issues of inequality, corruption, and discrimination, which continue to plague Nepali society. Consequently, alternative political parties and movements are emerging to challenge the political establishment’s dominance, offering some hope and opportunities. Yet they too are not free from challenges. Rise of new political forces In the rise of alternative politics in Nepal, new political forces such as the Bibeksheel Sajha Party, Naya Shakti Nepal, the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, and Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal have emerged in recent years, offering alternative visions of governance based on principles such as transparency, social justice, and equality. In addition to traditional parties, several alternative political parties also gained ground, reflecting the growing demand for change and reform in Nepali politics. In the  elections of 2022,  new political parties like Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janamat Party Nepal, Nagarik Unmukti Party and independent candidates were found on the rise. To the surprise of many, these parties managed seats in the parliamentary elections, making their parties national. The elections were seen as a sign of hope for many Nepali citizens who were disillusioned with the country’s traditional politicians. This was a significant achievement for new political parties and gave hope to many Nepali citizens who were looking for an alternative to the existing political parties. These parties were based on the principles of transparency, accountability, and good governance, and their manifestoes included policies such as anti-corruption measures, citizen participation in decision-making, and environmental protection as well as the issues of equal representation, social justice and the welfare of marginalised communities. The challenges Despite this initial success, these forces in alternative politics have been accused of falling into the same trap of dirty politics as the old political parties. This can be easily seen in the formation of the new government and the nomination of new presidential candidates. They were involved in various controversies and engaged in the same “dirty politics” as their predecessor. Many Nepali citizens who supported them in the initial stages have now turned to disappointment, and their popularity has taken a severe hit. The failure to deliver as per their promises has led to disillusionment among their supporters, and many are now questioning their integrity. These accusations have tarnished their image and led many Nepali citizens to question whether they truly represent alternative politics or a new generation of politicians. However, these parties also face significant challenges, such as building a broad-based coalition, navigating the complex web of vested interests and power structures, and developing a clear policy platform. To be successful, alternative political forces in Nepal will need to overcome several challenges, such as building a broad-based coalition, addressing the concerns of marginalised groups and developing a clear agenda and policy platform.  Additionally, alternative politics needs to navigate the complex web of vested interests and power structures that dominate Nepali politics.  Overall, the future of alternative politics in Nepal depends on the ability of these new political forces to mobilise and organise a broad-based movement for change, grounded in principles of transparency, social justice, and equality. While the path ahead is uncertain, the emergence of new political forces offers hope for a more inclusive and equitable future for Nepal.",political

Besides his own party, CPN-Maoist Centre, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, CPN-Unified Socialist, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janamat Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party and Rastriya Janamorcha voted for him. Nembang secured 15,518 votes from 96 federal and 162 provincial lawmakers.

Govt decides to register truth and reconciliation law amendment bill in parliament,"Kathmandu, March 9 The government has decided to register a bill in the parliament seeking an amendment to  The Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Act 2014  (TRC Act). A meeting of the Council of Ministers held in Kathmandu on Thursday morning made the decision, according to a source.  While concerns about  transitional justice issues are coming to the fore  once again, the government made a decision to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Act in its bid to conclude the peace process as soon as possible. The government launched a similar effort last year also, however, it was stalled halfway through the parliament as a section of lawmakers, as well as war survivor groups and human rights activists, opposed the government’s proposal to form a special judicial body to look into conflict-era criminal cases.  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday is hearing a  petition filed against Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal  concerning the murders of 5,000 people during the Maoist war.",political
Petition against PM: Failed promises of transitional justice in Nepal,"The 2006  Comprehensive Peace Accord  (CPA) formally ended Nepal’s  decade-long Maoist insurgency  (1996-2006). As transitional justice mechanisms follow such a post-conflict scenario to properly address the cases of human rights violations that happen during the conflict with the aim to foster peace, two bodies were established to facilitate transitional justice in Nepal, namely the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) and Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons ( CIEDP ). But 17 years down the line, promises of transitional justice in Nepal largely failed with almost all sides involved in the process dissatisfied. A recent  lawsuit filed against Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal  can be considered the epitome of dissatisfaction, which paints an uncertain picture of the future.  Transitional justice in Nepal: Principle and practice  According to  the Office of the Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), “Transitional justice consists of both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms, including truth-seeking, prosecution initiatives, reparations, and various measures to prevent the recurrence of new violations”.  Accordingly, to facilitate transitional justice in Nepal, a few years after the CPA, the first Constituent Assembly passed and the President approved legislation known as  The Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Act 2014  (TRC Act). However, the TRC Act has been a major controversy since the beginning, keeping transitional justice in Nepal in constant uncertainty. The Supreme Court of Nepal in the Suman Adhikari vs Government of Nepal case in 2015 stated that the act was against the constitution and also against existing international obligations. Even more baffling was the government’s review petition for the 2015 decision, which the Supreme Court rejected on April 27, 2020.  Recent responses Fast forward to 2022, the discussion around the amendment of the act and transitional justice in Nepal as a whole, yet again, came forward without much optimism. The Ministry of Law,  Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs tabled a  bill  in the parliament on July 15, 2022, to amend the existing TRC Act but it remained widely criticised. The division of human rights violations into two categories in the bill (human rights violations and grave human rights violations) was called out for not considering war crimes and crimes against humanity as grave human rights violations, and rather, creating a possible pathway for amnesties.  The National Human Rights Commission then provided a 12-point suggestion and asked that the categorisation of these crimes should be based on the existing international humanitarian laws and instruments. The bill has now already turned null and void with the expiry of the then House of Representatives (HoR) on September 22, 2022.  But this case has been evident to show how transitional justice in Nepal’s case – in the true sense and in accordance with international law – has not been a matter of priority. With the war-era cases coming to the front by different parties again, the issue is in the limelight today again. On March 5, 2023, nine political parties issued a statement to showcase their commitment to ensuring transitional justice. They have also assured that bill(s) related to transitional justice will be tabled in the federal parliament in the ongoing session. While they have mentioned that the bill(s) will be in compliance with previous Supreme Court orders, one shall not be surprised if it still creates loopholes to foster impunity.  Transitional justice in Nepal has now become of interest also because a writ petition against the incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in relation to conflict-era crimes has been filed in the Supreme Court. These political developments have sparked a little hope but also scepticism amongst people as to what political give and take might be making their way in between. However, there is still no certainty as to when justice will finally be ensured. Persistent failure Alongside such legal developments, it has also been disappointing to witness the failure of the institutions formed for transitional justice in Nepal. Clause 5.2.5 of the CPA states, “Both sides agree to set up a high-level TRC through a mutual agreement in order to investigate truths about people seriously violating human rights and involved in crimes against humanity, and to create an environment of reconciliations in the society”. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons  (CEIDP) were hence  established  in February 2015. But the trust in the established mechanisms and institutions to achieve transitional justice in Nepal eroded when such independent commissions failed to fulfil their due functions. The tenures of these commissions – once established in 2015 – were set for two years but they have been receiving multiple extensions with revisions in the existing act. In a similar manner, the government on July 15, 2022, extended the term of both commissions by three more months, which again, expired on October 17, 2022. The commissions have since then remained non-functioning as no leadership appointments have been made. The Maoist insurgency resulted in the deaths and disappearances of thousands of innocent people and many still await to see those who committed wartime atrocities to be punished. The CPA had promised to release the details of missing or killed people, but families are still seeking the whereabouts of their dear ones. Multiple governments have disregarded the urgency of the issue and have been unable to address the concerns of the victims and families.  Sexual violence survivors  still live with the trauma despite being promised special protection for their rights. A cycle of impunity in such ways has followed the war which has also been repeatedly questioned by the international community. In 2022, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Commission of Jurists  collecti vely called out the prioritisation of justice for conflict victims. Samantha Power, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), during her  visit to Nepal last month  also urged the government to deliver promises of transitional justice.  The CPN-Maoist Centre, Nepali Congress and CPN-UML have led the government but made no substantive efforts to move forward with transitional justice in Nepal. Rather, the current government led by the wartime leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal  declared February 13 a public holiday  to mark People’s War Day. How can one mark it as a happy occasion when no respect has been paid to the rule of law and no significant effort taken to deliver justice? An extension of the term is not the solution The only step taken towards transitional justice in Nepal so far is for the extension of the transitional justice commissions. These commissions have received  thousands of complaints  but not even a single one remains resolved to date. Section 42.1 of the TRC Act states that the government can take steps to remove any difficulty that may arise in the implementation of the act. Yet, the constant failure to amend the act in line with international law and maintain the transparent and efficient functioning of the commissions has stalled transitional justice in Nepal. Amid all this, Nepal has remained inattentive to the physical and mental exhaustion of victims as they wait for justice and peace. Moving forward, it is also important to focus on non-judicial mechanisms including reconciliation and trauma healing to provide justice, address the causes of violence, and transform relations.",political
"Missing connection: FSU elections are so close, but most students don’t care about them","Manish Thapa completed his school in an underdeveloped village in the Dailekh district of Karnali. But last year, he came to Kathmandu and joined the  Patan Multiple Campus  under Tribhuvan University to pursue a bachelor’s degree in business studies.  Before joining the college in Kathmandu, he thought that he would be studying in a well-facilitated and healthy environment. But the reality was so different that he felt discriminated against as the college administrators only listened to the leaders of student unions affiliated with the parties, not the real students. As the TU is approaching the free student union elections ( FSU elections ) later this month, the student unions are wooing people like Thapa of addressing their problems, but he is not convinced as he says the people who have been a part of the problem cannot make reforms.   Prajwal Bhandari of Bajura, Thapa’s classmate, agrees that the student unions that should have been responsible for regular internal exams and a well-managed library are making chaos on the campus. The biggest university in Nepal is organising the FSU elections on March 19 for the first time in the past 14 years, but several students like Thapa and Bhandari are not excited enough.  Lack of energy and excitement To prepare for the elections, student unions have set up help desks at the college premises. They have even started collecting advice from the students.  But, Bhandari and Thapa accuse them of coming into the class and creating disturbances in the name of collecting suggestions. Both of them think that the elected committee will not do anything remarkable for the college.  There are many others like them. “The student leaders may find it right to come and give a lecture amid the class, but for the genuine students they are creating a disturbance,” says Linji Chakradhar, a BA first-year student at  Ratna Rajya Laxmi Campus .   For her, the FSU elections do not hold any significance. She says she does not know much about student politics and is not interested in casting her vote in the elections.    Let’s go to the  Amrit Science Campus , another significant station in Kathmandu for the FSU elections.  Bibek Thakur, a bachelor-level third-year microbiology student there, says he does not have any interest in the elections. “I do not believe that the FSU elections are going to be held for the welfare of the students,” says Thakur.  The deviated path Kamala Limbu, a third-year student of BSc Mathematics, has a decent interest in politics. But, similar to Thakur, she is also not interested in the college elections.  “For me, the student unions work more for their parties rather than for the student’s rights,” says Limbu, highlighting the  problems the college has been facing of late . “ I have never seen them doing creative programmes for the betterment of students.” But, student leaders say the FSU is a key medium to fight for the rights of students. According to them, the absence of FSU at the colleges recently has troubled the students and their education. Similarly, they also claim that the activeness of FSU compels the college administration to maintain transparency and pressure them on the academic and infrastructure development of the college. However,  there are questions  if the FSU is still relevant given the student unions have focused their activities on political agenda, not academic ones. Hence, many consider such unions useless and unproductive. They are often blamed for creating an unhealthy environment at colleges. Most of the time they are involved in protests and fights rather than advocating for the students’ rights.   Educationalist Bidya Nath Koirala agrees. “All these reasons have made general students disappointed with the FSU elections. The student leaders, due to their displeased activities, have failed to gain the trust of general students.” Kalpana Lama, a bachelor’s third-year student at  Pashupati Multiple Campus , says that the FSU elections have only excited the student leaders. According to her, the general students are not concerned about it. The activeness among the student leaders has created an environment for elections in the college, but most of the general students are reluctant to get involved in it, says Lama.  Hoping against hope However, there are also some students, who despite having less knowledge, are excited to vote in the FSU elections. Ojashwi Neupane, a bachelor’s second-year student of geology at  Tri-Chandra Campus , is one among them. Just recently, she has known the name of student unions that will be participating in the election.  “I don’t know what they do and will do after winning the election, but I’m excited to cast my first vote in the FSU elections,” says Neupane.  Asmita Shahi, another student of the same college, studying her bachelor’s second year in social work, knew about the FSU elections through her friends. “I am not clear about the tasks of the student union. However, I’m excited to cast votes in the elections.”",political

Sudurpaschim CM Kamal Bahadur Shah gets a vote of confidence from two-thirds MPs,"Dhangadhi, March 5 Sudurpaschim Chief Minister Kamal Bahadur Shah has got a vote of confidence from over two-thirds of the members of the provincial assembly. During a vote held on Sunday, Shah of the Nepali Congress got a vote from 41 members of the 53-member assembly. Only 11 votes were cast against him whereas the speaker did not cast the last vote that the chief of the assembly is expected to use only when a motion remains undecided due to equal votes on both sides. All parties in the assembly except for the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party voted for Shah. Apparently thanks to the  change in the central-level political coalition , the CPN-Maoist Centre which had been talking about not supporting Shah also changed its decision at the eleventh hour.  Earlier last month, Shah was  appointed the chief minister  as the leader of the biggest party in the provincial legislature as per article 168(3) of  the constitution  after the coalition government formed under the leadership of UML’s Rajendra Rawal failed to win the vote of confidence. The Rawal government collapsed in a month.",political
Nepal needs to fix the balance of power to accelerate development: Why and how?,"The  concept of balance of power  refers to the distribution of political, economic, and military power among different actors in a society or international system. In developing countries such as Nepal, the balance of power is crucial for several reasons. Developing countries often have weak and fragile political institutions that are susceptible to corruption, authoritarianism, and abuse of power. This is because they lack the robust political systems that are developed in developed nations, such as strong political parties, an independent judiciary and an effective media that can hold  politicians accountable . As a result, it is common for leaders in developing nations to use their power to enrich themselves and their supporters at the expense of the wider population. This concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals or groups can lead to an unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, exacerbating social and economic inequalities. In such environments, a lack of balance of power can have serious consequences for society. Hence, in the context of Nepal, it can be fairly argued that fixing the balance of power can help solve various problems facing society and accelerate development.  Why fix the balance? The lack of balance of power in a country like Nepal can lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few. This eventually creates a situation where the strong exploit the weak. This can lead to social unrest and instability, as marginalised groups become frustrated and disillusioned with the political system. Furthermore, it can lead to authoritarianism, where leaders use their power to suppress dissent and maintain their hold on power. This can have a chilling effect on civil society and limit the free expression of ideas and opinions, creating a culture of fear and intimidation. A balanced distribution of power, on the other hand, ensures that no single individual or group has too much power and influence over the political, economic, or social landscape. This helps to prevent abuses of power, protect the rights of individuals and ensure that decisions are made in the interest of the broader population, rather than just a selected few people. In a balanced system, power is distributed among different actors, such as political parties, civil society organisations and independent media. This creates a system of checks and balances that helps to prevent the concentration of power and promotes greater accountability and transparency. For example, in a system where there is a balance of power, political parties can serve as a check on the power of the government. They can provide alternative policy proposals, mobilise citizens, and hold the government accountable for its actions.  Similarly, an independent judiciary can ensure that the rule of law is respected and that citizens have access to justice. Free and independent media can serve as a watchdog, holding politicians and other actors accountable for their actions and providing citizens with accurate information about what is happening in their society. Secondly, a balance of power is essential for promoting economic growth and development in developing nations. In many developing countries, a few wealthy individuals or companies may control a large share of the resources and opportunities, which can create barriers to entry for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs. This, in turn, can stifle innovation, competition, and growth.  A balance of power, however, can help to promote a more competitive and dynamic economic environment, with a greater diversity of actors participating in the economy. This can lead to more innovation, investment, and job creation, ultimately promoting long-term economic growth and development. Making this world a better place In a balanced economic system, small businesses and entrepreneurs have a greater chance to succeed as they are not overshadowed by larger, more established players. Furthermore, a balanced economic system can help to promote a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, reducing social and economic inequalities. For example, in a balanced economic system, there is greater competition in the market, which leads to lower prices for consumers and greater efficiency in the allocation of resources. Small businesses and entrepreneurs have a greater chance to succeed, as they are not overshadowed by larger, more established players. Furthermore, a balanced economic system can promote greater social mobility and reduce poverty as individuals from all backgrounds have the opportunity to participate in the economy and access resources and opportunities. This, in turn, can help build a more inclusive and sustainable society. Moreover, the balance of power is critical for promoting stable governance, sustainable economic growth, and social justice. Nepal has a history of political instability, with frequent changes in government and corruption allegations. The concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals or groups has contributed to this instability, as well as to inequalities in wealth and opportunity. To address these challenges, Nepal needs to establish a balanced distribution of power among political parties, civil society organisations and independent media.  This will help to promote greater accountability and transparency, reduce corruption, and ensure that decisions are made in the interest of all Nepali citizens. By establishing a more balanced system of power, Nepal can build a more inclusive, resilient, and prosperous society for all its citizens.",political
No political parties are willing to take over the Education Ministry. What does it imply?,"Education is an important aspect of a country’s development and can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and the overall society. It is important for governments to prioritise education and make sure that it is adequately funded and supported. It is also important for citizens to hold their governments accountable for their commitments and to advocate for policies that promote access to quality education for all. It means the Education Ministry should be one of the important ministries of any government. But, in Nepal, political parties have just neglected it of late.  A case of neglect After the  Nepal Swatantra Party decided to pull out of the government , there is no education minister in the country. In principle, the prime minister now heads the  Education Ministry , but it is apparent that this is just a nominal arrangement. This move highlights the lack of prioritisation given to the education sector by Nepali political parties. Despite the popular commitment to improving the education system in Nepal as stated in their political manifestos, the recent action demonstrates a disregard for the other sector. This is particularly concerning given the crucial role education plays in a country’s development and the impact it has on future generations. It is imperative that Nepali political parties prioritise the education sector, and the Education Ministry for that purpose, and take concrete steps to improve the quality of education in the country. This could include increasing investment in the sector, improving teacher professional development training, and creating a more inclusive education system that provides equal opportunities for all. Promises vs reality The  Constitution of Nepal  says education is a fundamental right. It stated that every citizen shall have the right to get compulsory and free education up to the basic level and free education up to the secondary level from the country. Accordingly, all the parties have mentioned in their respective election manifestos that education will be made scientific, technical, skill-oriented and professional. Since 1992, when the election manifesto of the major parties are published, some of the election agenda has not been completed for three decades. However, in each election, all the political parties have repeated the same types of commitment for consecutive three decades but neglected implementation.  The major parties had promised to eradicate illiteracy since 1992. However, still, millions of Nepali citizens in the age group of 15 to 60 years are illiterate.  For example, the Nepali Congress put forward an agenda to eradicate illiteracy in 1948. In the current manifesto, it is written, “In the next five years, the literacy rate of women between the ages of 15-24 will be increased to 95 per cent, and 80 per cent of educational institutions will have access to the Internet.”  Likewise, this time, UML has included in the manifesto that the country will be fully literate in the next two years. The Nepali Congress has been supporting the current government and  preparing to join it soon . The UML was a part of the government  until a few days ago . But, no parties raised an issue about filling the vacancy at the Education Ministry. Without the Education Ministry has given priority, there is no possibility that their commitments for the sector are implemented.  In the political parties’ manifestoes, there are several promises that have been repeated, like community school reform, doubling investment in education and quality education, free education, quality and scientific education, eradication of illiteracy, access to education for all, and scholarships for the backward and poor citizens in their manifestos.  Moreover, the main political parties now have an agenda linking education with technology and business etc. But, none of the political parties has a detailed plan on how a budget can be increased from the current 10-11 per cent to 20 per cent.  Lack of strategy and action But, again, you know no parties are interested to head the Education Ministry. It means they are not ready to walk the talk. Perhaps that is why no one has written on how to implement the commitments made in the manifesto, how to arrange the budget for efficient implementation of the plan, or what about the existing resources.  This time also parties put forward an attractive educational agenda in the election manifestoes, but people doubt that after winning the elections, they do not pay attention to its implementation losing people’s trust in them. Yet, all the political parties have included educational agendas in their manifestos for the upcoming five years. Let’s hope they will be accountable for their commitment once they prioritise the Education Ministry.",political
"They fought Nepal civil war for a change, and the war changed their lives for the worse","Dukha Ram Chaudhary of Ghorahi in Dang, who turned 75 this year, remembers the day during the  Nepal civil war (1996-2006)  when the Maoists came and showed the future of change. They used to say, “This fight is not for us, it is for the people. All kinds of discrimination like caste untouchability, and class discrimination will end. Our lives will change.” At the beginning of the conflict, Chaudhary also thought that after the tough days of the civil war, inequality, discrimination, poverty and oppression would all end for real. “We thought our sorrows would end, happy days would come and our lives would change.” Meanwhile, his second eldest daughter Sita was shot dead by the army in the forest near her house on June 22, 2002. Despite the pain of losing his daughter, even with a heavy price to pay for the conflict, he still had hope of change in his heart. He thought, “Her blood will not be wasted.” Today, after 27 years, he does not feel the same. Because the  armed conflict  that started with sharing the dream of changing the standard of living of the people could not bring any change in the life of a common citizen like him. Instead, he had to bear the loss of her daughter. “The civil war gave us nothing. All I can do now is cry remembering my daughter.” There has been no change in his life. Chaudhary used to farm all day. His life was difficult yesterday; even after working all year round, he was not able to eat properly. His children too struggled with poverty and suffering. They could not read and write well. And, his children are now working as wage labourers. Expectation vs reality On February 13, 1996, the then-rebel Maoists party started an armed conflict by attacking the police station of Holeri in  Rolpa , Aathbiskot Rukum and Sindhuligadhi in Sindhuli on the same day. The civil war that started from here and spread throughout the country changed the political system with a new democratic revolution.  But the suffering of the residents of Rukum, Rolpa, Dang, Salyan, Jajarkot, Bardiya and other districts who suffered excessively in the war did not change. Although the 10-year civil war brought social awareness among the citizens, it did not bring about a change in their living standards. The 55-year-old Daman Nepali from Ghorahi of Dang is a survivor of the conflict. He experienced all kinds of scenarios of conflict, first-hand, and still remembers the early days of the conflict very well.  At that time, caste discrimination and untouchability were deeply rooted in society. Dalits were banned from performing prayers in temples and going near water ponds. They were not even allowed to drink water in the house of those from the “upper caste”. He says, “In the name of caste discrimination, I had to suffer many kinds of insults and contempt.” To end that oppression, Maoists launched a campaign against caste untouchability during the civil war. “The war taught us to speak against injustice, gave us the confidence to fight for rights,” he says, with the confidence he got from the war to speak openly against discrimination. The endless crisis The civil war has largely destroyed many such social differences and worked to bring social awareness and awakening among people. But it could not bring  transformation  to their lives. “Some things did change after the war, but not our lives; it is the same today, living amid scarcity.” Rolpa and Rukum, the origin of the conflict, suffered heavy losses including the lives of 1,600 people who were killed–965 from Rolpa and 663 from Rukum. Apart from that, there was a series of violent killings and disappearances as well as many abuses and tortures inflicted upon the villagers.  Khem Budha, a civil society leader of Rolpa, also says that living in the district, he could not feel the promised change.  As a result of the civil war, the country achieved the establishment of a republic, with an inclusive proportional representation in all tiers of government, and people writing their constitution through their representatives. But none of the changes uplifted the living condition of the people. “But the war did make the citizens aware, gave them confidence and brought awareness,” he says, “It did not change the living standards. The rural economy should have changed as an achievement of the war, but nothing happened.” On the contrary, he says, agricultural production and rural income have further decreased. “The youth population has turned to foreign employment.” Problems getting worse While many things remained the same even after the civil war, some things changed–for the worse. Tirtha Acharya, the president of the National Alliance of Women’s Human Rights Defenders (Rolpa), says that although the conflict has brought awareness about gender equality, there has been no change in behaviour. “Many women here are still under the grip of violence while  child marriage  is increasing. And there is a lack of investment in education and health.” The condition of the Maoist fighters, who entered the armed conflict with the dream of change, is even more painful. They have not been able to feel the change which they fought so hard to bring. Those who carried the wounded in the civil war have not even received good treatment today. Lal Bahadur Oli and Sita KC a couple of Tulsipur-17 in Dang, are an example of this. Both were former Maoist fighters who were wounded in the conflict.  The duo walked in the path to change, but KC is left with a bullet in her body and Oli has lost his sight. Both of them are not happy with the changes brought about by fighting the decade-long civil war. “We got wounded bodies as a gift of fighting a war. The same gave power to the leaders, and we were left alone.” The duo have not received proper treatment and are spending more on medicine and treatment, month after month. Both of them are unable to work and it is difficult for them to manage their household affairs. The couple do not have big demands; they just want the government to acknowledge them as war survivors and give them free treatment. The civil war gave nothing to the people like them. “We gave our blood and that changed the country, but our days have not changed,” KC says, adding, “The irony is that their commander is in power today, yet they are forgotten. That’s why I have no hope now. Our leaders do not see our tears today.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Koshi: Province 1 finally becomes the last province to get its name,"Biratnagar, March 2 In the sixth year of its existence, Province 1 finally renamed itself Koshi on Wednesday to become the last of the seven provinces recognised after the implementation of the 2015 constitution. An overwhelming majority of the Provincial Assembly last night endorsed a proposal of the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre to name the province. When it was put to vote, 82 lawmakers cast in favour whereas only four were against it. The assembly also rejected another proposal of the CPN-Unified Socialist and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal that wanted to name the province Kirat Limbuwan Sagarmatha. In 2022, the assembly  completed its first term without naming  the province.  The  2015 constitution , introducing federalism, divided the country into seven provinces without naming them.

FSU elections: Here’s all about the elections that Tribhuvan University is holding at its colleges,"Just last year, Nepal witnessed three national elections in a row—to elect local, provincial and federal legislative and executive bodies. While national politics is all centred on  the presidential election  to be held next week, there is some other election that a significant size of the country’s youth is thinking of now: the FSU elections.  Tribhuvan University , the oldest and biggest university in Nepal, has announced to hold the elections of free student unions (FSUs) at its constituent and affiliated colleges on March 19. So what are these FSU elections all about? Onlinekhar explains here.  What are these FSUs? The history of FSU as an institution dates back to 1960. Student unions came into existence as resistance to the late King Mahendra Shah’s autocratic Panchayat system he began after dissolving the first democratically elected parliament and taking control of executive powers.  The situation created a space for student politics at the old university, which consequently resulted in the elections. The first FSU elections were held in 1962.   The FSU is also known as the hub for potential leaders who can lead the country in the future. There are many top-notch politicians in the current Nepali political scenario who got a rise from the FSU, such as Sher Bahadur Deuba, Gagan Thapa, Ram Kumari Jhakri, Shankar Pokhrel and Yogesh Bhattarai to name a few.  The FSU elections will be held among student leaders of the colleges affiliated with the TU. The candidates are basically the representatives of the student unions affiliated with major political parties. The voters include the students who have officially enrolled at the institution.  The election at each college elects a committee consisting of the president, vice president, secretary, joint secretary, treasurer and members. The number of members varies from college to college. But, it’s no more the Panchayat system. Why do they exist today? Student leaders say that FSU is the key medium to fight for the rights of students. According to them, the absence of FSU at the colleges recently has troubled the students and their education. Similarly, they also claim that the activeness of FSU compels the college administration to maintain transparency and pressure them on the academic and infrastructure development of the college. However,  there are questions  if the FSU is still relevant given the student unions have focused their activities on political agenda, not academic ones. Hence, many consider such unions useless and unproductive. They are often blamed for creating an unhealthy environment at colleges. Most of the time they are involved in protests and fights rather than advocating for the students’ rights.  Perhaps that is why most of the privately run affiliated colleges do not hold the FSU elections whereas it has been a norm at constituent colleges run by the TU itself.  When do the elections happen? The FSU elections are supposed to take place every two years. But due to political instability and disputes among student leaders and college administration, the FSU elections could not take place on time. The FSU elections, which are scheduled for March 19 are going to take place in full fledge after 14 years in the country the last full-fledged FSU elections took place in 2009 at all its constituents and affiliated colleges.  In 2017, the FSU elections were organised, but only 170 colleges participated in them. This time, however, the TU expects to hold the elections at all over 1,000 constituent and affiliated colleges.  Who can contest? A candidate must be a student, not crossing the age of 28 years old. Likewise, the candidate must have one proposer and one seconder among the voters.  How do the elections happen?  The FSU elections follow a mixed electoral system as the House of Representatives elections. It means voting will be held under both first-past-the-post (FPTP) and proportional representation systems.  An 11-member committee will be elected at a college that has a maximum of 200 students. A 15-member committee will be elected if the number of students is between 201 and 1,000. Similarly, the committee will have 19 members if the college has 1,000 to 3,000 students. In case the number of students is more than 3,000, there will be 21 members on the committee.",political

UML leaves the Dahal government 3 days after the PM ditched the alliance,"Kathmandu, February 27 The CPN-UML, the biggest party in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, has decided to leave the government and withdraw the support given to the cabinet.

Women in Nepali politics: The president that made you ‘proud’ is leaving. What’s next?,"President Bidya Devi Bhandari is retiring next month after completing two terms in the top political office in the country. While her stay in office has been  criticised for many wrongs , there is at least one thing that almost every Nepali agrees about; President Bhandari gave an example of the growing presence of women in Nepali politics. An  election has been scheduled  for March 9 to elect Bhandari’s successor, but there is  no female candidate contesting . It means the country might still find a woman to be the vice president as the constitution requires representatives of different genders OR ethnic groups in the top two positions. But, everyone knows  the vice presidency is a frustrating job .  So perhaps it is time to review the presence of women in Nepali politics, which apparently is male-dominated historically and forecast the future. Current status  Almost every government in Nepal gives more priority to men during political appointments. Let’s begin a review of the presence of women in Nepali politics with the current federal council of ministers. Among  19 members of the council  (the resignation submitted by four council members representing the Rastriya Prajatrantra Party has not been approved yet), five are women, which is just 25 per cent of the whole.    The  current provincial governments  have a more pathetic condition as far as women’s participation is concerned. Whereas all provinces except Sudurpaschim (where  the cabinet  is yet to get a full shape) have only one woman in their cabinets, Madhesh has two. Needless to say, all the chief ministers are men.  The nation that prides itself on having a woman as the second president in history has never had a female president has never got a female prime minister. No one knows when a female chief executive will rule Nepal as  no female leader has reached the top level  of any big party’s leadership to claim the position. As of today, among several parties that are making the news, only Nagarik Unamukti Party and Bibeksheel Sajha Party have elected women as their heads. But, their party do not have a powerful voice in national politics; Nagarik Unmukti is represented in the parliament, but it is not a national party. Bibeksheel Sajha does not have a presence in the House.  At the province level, however,  Asta Laxmi Shakya got a chance  to lead the council of ministers in Bagmati in 2021 although  it was just for just two few months . When the new provincial governments got formed after the elections in November 2022, there was not any report that any woman desired to take over the provincial leadership.  A failure to learn Experts say Nepal can learn from various developing countries to promote the participation of women in Nepali politics. Rwanda is one of those countries. The Eastern African country has had the  highest proportion of female lawmakers  in the world since 2003, with 61 per cent now in the lower house. Four of the nation’s seven Supreme Court justices are women, including the deputy chief justice According to  World Bank , Rwanda has achieved impressive development gains since the 1994 genocide and civil war.  Compare it with the presence of women in Nepali politics. The country’s parliamentary law has it that there should be at least 33 per cent of women in the legislative units at both federal and provincial levels. For the want of women elected directly, the parties and the Election Commission are forced to push women to legislative bodies through the proportional representation system. Nepal also has had a woman as its chief justice, but as of now, only two female  justices are there at the apex court  while there are 14 men.  So what? Former Chief Minister Shakya says it feels sad to see female politicians not getting equal opportunities. She says the existing scenario makes her feel like the involvement of thousands of women in Nepali politics and their contribution to building the nation has been neglected, as she says everyone regardless of their gender has contributed to establishing democracy, she says.  “We have a wonderful constitution which considers men and women equally, but the equality is limited to papers only.” Most of the top leaders and powerful people in the political parties are male with feudalistic thoughts. “They think the women are inferior and will fail in taking the right political decisions,” she adds.   Political analyst Indra Adhikari also agrees with Shakya, adding the miserable presence of women in Nepali politics is the result of a conservative social structure and socialisation. “The prevalence of stereotyped thinking regarding women’s capacity has not still created a favourable condition for women in Nepali politics,” says Adhikari.   Likewise, the failure of female leaders to raise their voices for equal opportunities within their parties has also created such a situation, according to her.  In her view, women feel insecure within their parties as most of the powerholders are from the other sex. Consequently, they fail to receive the potential opportunities and also lose their present positions. “Such kind of insecurities is creating silence among existing women in Nepali politics,” she says. Nepali Congress leader Chitra Lekha Yadav says agrees with Adhikari and says the deprivation of power to women is a breach of the constitution. “Fine, there is no one to be the PM from the women in Nepali politics. But, why didn’t they give one deputy prime ministership to them while recruiting three?” she questions. “The top-level politicians, mostly men, still think that the politics are just made for them,” says Yadav. “They always prefer to give second positions to them such as deputy mayor, deputy speaker, vice chairperson and others.”",political
Bidya Devi Bhandari is leaving more vices than virtues in her legacy as Nepal’s president,"When Bidya Devi Bhandari was elected  the president of Nepal , people in and outside Nepal saw a sign of progress. For the first time in its history, Nepal had appointed a female head of state, and all, especially women, were  hopeful about what this meant for them .  The President Women Upliftment Programme, initiated by Bhandari, did some good in terms of empowering women through social and economic means. The programme also focussed on increasing access to education, health and social services, eliminating the trafficking of women and girls, and ending social malpractices and gender-based violence. This programme has been a significant aspect of her tenure. However, during her time at Sheetal Niwas as the president of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari has also faced criticisms, perhaps more than compliments.  The partisan president The most serious accusation against President Bhandari is her inability to rise above partisan beliefs and the pressure from her (previous) party’s leadership. The first incident related to this was when she nominated a member of the National Assembly, who was a political appointee. On February 9, 2018, the government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba recommended the appointment of Krishna Prasad Poudel, Gopal Kumar Basnet, and Chandani Joshi as members of the National Assembly. However, President Bhandari did not implement this recommendation for more than two weeks. After the Deuba-led government was replaced by KP Sharma Oli on February 20, 2018, Bhandari  promptly approved the recommendation  to make Yuba Raj Khatiwada, Ram Narayan Bidari and Bimala Rai Paudyal members of the National Assembly. After being elected as the president, there is a practice of resigning from their respective parties. Bhandari did so too, but in many cases, she took decisions in favour of her party the UML. To resolve the dispute within the unified Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed by the merger of the UML and the Maoist Centre, the leaders were summoned to collective and individual meetings by Bidya Devi Bhandari Bhandari. During that time, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal were standing against KP Sharma Oli. To resolve dispute, she even called leader Bamdev Gautam at Sheetal Niwas to resolve the dispute. After the president urged Oli to reconcile, UML leader Bhim Rawal publicly criticised the move stating Bhandarai was violating the dignity and prestige of the president by supporting one side in an internal issue. President Bhandari had discussions with Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal, Bishnu Poudel, and others to help resolve the dispute. According to sources, Bhandari also called all members of the secretariat of the erstwhile NCP and discussed the party dispute.  During the NCP dispute, both Oli and Dahal both knowingly or unknowingly gave space to the president.  The internal dispute of NCP took another turn as the  Supreme Court dissolved the party’s unity  over a dispute related to the party’s name. Even after that, she continued to provide support to the Oli-led government. Following the NCP split,  Oli dissolved the House of Representatives . Disregarding constitutional provisions, Bhandari upheld the decision to dissolve the house and announced dates for the early elections. Bhandari was heavily criticised for this as the  Supreme Court revoked the decision  calling it unconstitutional. Oli once  again dissolved the House  and Bhandari supported the move again, but the move was once again  cancelled out by the Supreme Court . Before the dissolution of the House of Representatives, Sher Bahadur Deuba had claimed the support of 149 lawmakers for the position of Prime Minister, but President Bidya Devi Bhandari had refused to appoint him claiming he did not have enough support.  Bhandari also supported UML chief KP Sharma Oli when he tried to fill 52 posts at various constitutional commissions by bypassing the Parliamentary Hearing Committee.  Oli had issued an ordinance allowing the Constitutional Council to convene a meeting even with three members, and in such a situation, a decision could be made with a majority (two members). According to the aforementioned ordinance, the council meeting held on December 15, 2020, had recommended 32 individuals for appointment to constitutional bodies such as the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), Election Commission, and National Human Rights Commission, among others. Those recommended individuals were appointed to their respective positions without a parliamentary hearing and have since taken the oath of office from the President. Pleasure in power Bidya Devi Bhandari as the president had limited constitutional rights. Her main role was to authenticate government decisions as well as bills passed by the legislative. But, looking at her seven years in office, she behaved differently based on who was leading the government. During her first term, President Bhandari suspended the medical education ordinance for a long time without any reason. The government during the time was led by Deuba.  Many criticised her move. After the government objected to her move, she passed it and sent it back to the lower house. On April 21, 2020, the president issued a political party-related ordinance. After reaching the peak of the dispute between the then-ruling party Nepal Communist Party, she revoked the ordinance four days later. Criticism was raised that revoking the ordinance after only four days was not appropriate. On the same day, 83 lawmakers tried to submit a petition to President Bidya Devi Bhandari saying that a special session should be called after the issuance of the ordinance related to the Constitutional Council. The letter was not registered even when the NCP leaders Bhim Rawal and Pampha Bhusal waited for over five hours. According to leader Rawal, Hari Paudel, the secretary of the President’s Office, consulted the President and said that he would come with the registration number. But later, he switched off his phone and disappeared. Nepali Congress leader Pradeep Poudel, speaking satirically about the government’s performance, said in a parliamentary meeting on February 15, “The country needs a rubber-stamp president who keeps the seal at home and hides the secretary if needed,” he said. This comes as Bidya Devi Bhandari, time and again, has passed ordinances brought by the Oli-led government compared to the Deuba-led government. President Bhandari has remained silent on the citizenship bill passed twice by both houses of the federal parliament. The president, who is considered ceremonial, only signs the decision of the executive and administrative if she deems fit and has the power to not sign it. The Citizenship Bill, after it was passed by both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, was sent to the present for verification by Speaker Agni Sapkota on July 31, 2022.  However, on August 14, 2022, Bhandari returned the bill to the lower house with a 15-point suggestion. The returned Citizenship Bill was re-endorsed by both houses and sent to the president again on September 5. According to the constitution, she had to verify the bill within 15 days.  But, she did not . Nor did she state why she did not verify the bill. The case against the president for her role in this is still sub judice in court. Review the role now After reviewing Bidya Devi Bhandari’s term, there is a demand in the newly-elected parliament to discuss the powers held by the president. Speaking at the House of Representatives meeting on February 15, Pradeep Yadav from Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSPN) said that the president had not certified bills sent by the Federal Parliament twice, including the citizenship bill.  “It is necessary to discuss  the president’s veto  in the parliament,” said Yadav. Nepali Congress senior leader Ram Chandra Paudel also says that the role of the president should be clearly defined in the coming days. “We must use this as a learning experience and carry out our work,” says Paudel. Santosh Pariyar, chief whip of Rastriya Swatantra Party, says there is a place for politics and that place is not in the president’s office. Rajendra Dahal, the communication advisor to President Ram Baran Yadav (Bidya Devi Bhandari’s predecessor), says that the constitution of Nepal envisages that the president “does not make mistakes”. “It means the president is above everything else. But what has happened recently has raised a lot of concerns regarding the role of the president at the public level,” says Dahal. Former ambassador Vijaya Kanta Karna says that the role of the president should be discussed in the parliament. “The parties gave President Bidya Devi Bhandari a chance to be involved in politics. In order to stop this from happening, new laws need to be drafted on what the president can and cannot do,” says Karna. Due to a lack of laws regarding the president’s powers, the current president is able to perform actions such as summoning various government agencies for discussions, holding talks with army generals, and providing foreign media with exclusive interviews without seeking permission from the government. “The current system is an example of the dual rule in Nepal. It’s like what happened during the Panchayat era when the country was ruled by both the palace and the government,” says Karna.

Ram Chandra Paudel vs Subas Chandra Nembang: Big parties finalise presidential candidates,"Kathmandu, February 25 Ram Chandra Paudel and Subas Chandra Nembang have been picked as the presidential candidates of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress respectively to contest the  Nepal presidential election on March 9 . With a newly formed  eight-party alliance supporting Paudel , he is almost certain to win the race. But, as the UML also picked a key leader as the candidate, there are speculations that its chairman KP Sharma Oli might have some secret plans to turn the tables in the eleventh hour. The speculations are supported by the UML’s decision to not withdraw from the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government and take initiatives to woo parties other than Congress until the presidential vote next week. The  Election Commission  says the candidates can file their nominations by 3 pm.",political
"Presidential election: Maoist Centre, Unified Socialist, JSPN, others to back Nepali Congress","Kathmandu, February 24 It is highly likely that the Nepali Congress candidate will win the  Nepal presidential election  scheduled  for March 9  as Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN-Maoist Centre and some other major parties decided to back the biggest party. The Congress, however, is yet to decide who will be the party’s candidate. The  Election Commission  has allocated five hours on Saturday to file nominations, hence the party will have to make a decision by tomorrow morning.  As reported, the Maoist Centre, the CPN-Unified Socialist, and the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on Thursday decided to field Unified Socialist leader Madhav Kumar Nepal for the president. But, today, leaders of the parties, Nepal included, decided to back the Nepali Congress for the president, informs the party leader Prakash Jwala. Other smaller parties including the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Janamat Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party and Rastriya Janamorcha have also agreed to the decision, meaning it will be easy for the newly formed alliance to win the presidential election. As agreed, all these parties will support the JSPN candidate for the vice presidential election to be held a few days after the presidential one. With the new development, the  Maoist Centre’s agreement to support the CPN-UML candidate  for the presidential election has been ineffective, meaning the current ruling alliance is broken.",political
Nepal backs UN resolution against Russia’s hostilities in Ukraine,"Washington DC, February 24 Nepal has voted in favour of the United Nations (UN) non-binding resolution that condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UN resolution calls for Russia to end its hostilities in Ukraine and remove its forces from its neighbouring country. Nepal, taking part in an emergency Special General Assembly held in the UN Headquarters in New York on Thursday, voted in favour of the resolution that calls for the restoration of peace in Ukraine. A total of 141 nations, out of 193 UN member countries, backed the resolution approved by the UN General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of the invasion. Nepal’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Amrit Rai said Nepal’s backing of the UN resolution to end hostilities in Ukraine sends a strong message that is in favour of Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence. “Through the voting, we urged for finding ways for restoring peace in Ukraine,” Rai said. The UN has expressed its concerns over increasing food insecurity, inflation and poverty due to disruptions in the global supply chain owing to Russia’s hostilities in Ukraine for a year. When 141 nations including Nepal supported the resolution, 32 abstained and seven: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua, Syria and Russia voted against it. On October 23, 2022, the UN General Assembly has  passed a resolution  with a large majority condemning the barbaric and brutal attack by Russia on Ukraine, with 143 member-states voting in favour of it.

2 decades of new anti-corruption law in Nepal: A story of the target missed,"One fine day in 2002, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority ( CIAA ) received a letter from Nepal Rastra Bank ( NRB ). The letter stated the sitting chief of Tribhuvan International Airport, Khem Raj Bhattarai, had amassed money and other properties illegally. When the CIAA officials first saw the letter, they thought it was a hoax. But the officials called the NRB and found the letter was not a hoax, after which they raided Bhattarai’s house. The CIAA officials found Rs 122,000 and USD 1,600 in cash along with many luxurious items and 84 bottles of high-end liquor. The officials also raided his wife’s bank locker and found half a kilogram of gold. A few months later, CIAA officials were busy again. King Gyanendra Shah enacted  Nepal’s new anti-corruption law , the  Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002 , which resulted in the CIAA officials raiding the houses of 22 government officials working in revenue and customs offices at hone. Out of the 22, only three escaped trial. After three decades of the Panchayat system ended, Nepal was established as a multiparty democracy in 1990. Despite big hopes, the new system brought a lot of instability in its first decade. Government officials working in customs, revenue and construction took advantage of the instability, which necessitated a new anti-corruption law. “The people then were proud of how much property they could amass through bribery and corruption,” says an undersecretary working in the justice system, “It was normal for these officials to buy luxury goods and showcase them and make people jealous.” The life of a government staffer until 2000 was quite easy as times were simple back then. Officials who worked in offices where they could earn money through other means did not have ways to spend it. The land was cheap, but they could not buy excess land as it would raise suspicion. Buying other items would raise suspicion too. Hence, many started hoarding cash and gold at home as there were no investment opportunities.  “With the new anti-corruption law, we wanted to take action against people like these,” says a current judge who worked for the CIAA then. It has already been more than 20 years since the law came into effect. But, in retrospect, the law largely failed in its target to control corruption in the country. The first action King Gyandendra Shah, after taking the throne following  the 2001 royal massacre , wanted to put an end to this and passed four acts to prevent corruption.  Following that, news of corruption in various government organisations started to surface starting with the Royal Nepal Airlines corruption case and many others including the Sugar scandal and Dhamija scandal. Post 2000s, other scandals came to light including the Pajero and Prado scandal, the Czech Air scandal, the China South Air scandal and the Lauda Air scandal. The state made little progress in these cases as it did not find enough proof. Following this, a new provision was made in the Prevention of Corruption Act, based on the concept of investigating the assets of those who commit corruption and hide the evidence. Section 20 of the anti-corruption law provided that any public servant and public office holder can be investigated and prosecuted if they are found to have acquired unnatural wealth compared to their legitimate earnings. Surya Nath Upadhyay, the then head of the CIAA, who found such a strong legal tool in the new anti-corruption law, took action by making a list of 22 people with the help of a core team. According to the concept of illegal wealth acquisition, the authority investigates if people in public service acquire unnatural and disproportionate assets. If it is confirmed that the asset is illegal and if the person cannot reveal the source, it is considered corruption. If the charges of corruption are confirmed, there is a provision of imprisonment for up to two years and a fine as per the amount of corruption done and confiscation of illegal property. According to the investigation officers at the time, the CIAA started investigating the acquisition of illegal assets based on two important bases. Firstly, complaints were being filed against employees who had earned wealth overnight.  A parliamentary committee formed under the leadership of Pari Thapa submitted a report on the alarming situation of revenue leakage. Around the same time, the Property Investigation Commission formed by the government under the leadership of Supreme Court Justice Bhairav ​​Prasad Lamsal started investigating the property of those who assumed public office after 1990. Based on the report submitted by him, the authority was investigating high-ranking officials and prosecuting them. By 2006, based on the anti-corruption law, the CIAA prosecuted former ministers Govinda Raj Joshi, Khum Bahadur Khadka and Jay Prakash Gupta, ultimately ending their political careers. Several other former secretaries and heads of various institutes were also dragged for earning unnatural wealth. Gokarna Paudel, the private secretary of the then Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, was also charged with corruption but was acquitted later.  The waning days But after 2013, the CIAA has not been able to prosecute many high-ranking officials as it has only prosecuted ex-minister Ram Kumar Shrestha. In 2006, when Upadhyay was head of the CIAA, he was accused of acting in the interest of the palace by attacking those affiliated with Nepali Congress and not the UML. “What the CIAA did was a political attack on parties,” says former Nepali Congress lawmaker Radhe Shyam Adhikari. “This is mentioned in former lieutenant general  Vivek Kumar Shah’s book .” After Upadhyay’s retirement, no cases of illegal wealth acquisition were conducted due to the absence of the CIAA head. But, during this time, corruption cases continued in the country, but people stopped showing off their wealth, learning from the past mistakes of others. “There was a time when these officials bought chandeliers worth Rs 2 million to put in their new houses. After 2006, the sale of items like these stopped,” says a former CIAA official.  While the anti-corruption law was dormant, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat introduced the Self Declaration of Income programme in the 2000/01 budget. The programme would legalise the person’s undisclosed asset or wealth if s/he paid a tax. The CIAA had filed a case at the Supreme Court, asking to revoke the decision and the court did so, deeming the assets of many government employees illegal. But that move did not help the CIAA as people stopped showing or boasting wealth in the public. These people, instead, started investing money in the name of relatives and friends. It means the anti-corruption law could not use its powers. “These people did not trust their brothers or sister. Instead, they started to put money in the accounts of their in-laws. Hence, the CIAA started to investigate their in-laws too,” says the former CIAA official. Between 2002 and 2003, after the activism of the authorities, people in public positions started hiding their wealth even more. Those who were under investigation for illegal wealth acquisition were getting acquitted. “People started to get clever,” he says. Attacking the weak When  the Maoist war  was at its height, people displaced from all over the country started coming to Kathmandu. Land prices started to rise. Those who earned through corruption but had to hide their assets due to fear of authorities invested in land in the name of relatives.  Meanwhile, following Upadhyay’s retirement, the CIAA did not have a commissioner for five years. It means the anti-corruption law gathered dust.  In 2013, Lokman Singh Karki became the chief commissioner. There were rumours that using the anti-corruption law, he was going to take action against corrupt individuals. Using the report prepared by Lamsal, Karki took action against a few. But then, he did nothing in regard to major corruption cases. Yet, a 13-page form of the CIAA continued to terrorise government employees among others. Karki even said that he would investigate the properties of lawmakers Surendra Pandey, Bijay Poudyal and others who raised questions about his activities.  A  Supreme Court order in 2017 ended Karki’s rule  at the CIAA, but it did not make any impact on the commission’s proactiveness in properly utilising the anti-corruption law. In the last decade, only 68 cases of illegal wealth acquisition have been filed by the CIAA including two in the current fiscal year. Interestingly, most of the cases are against lower-level employees. A number of cases have been filed against secretarial-level employees. As in other cases of corruption, the authority has limited the investigation of illegal wealth acquisition to non-political public officials. If we look at one exception, in the last five years, investigations have not been carried out on ministers, parliamentarians, and high-ranking officials who have been politically appointed. Two years ago, when Navin Ghimire became the chief commissioner, the investigation into illegal wealth acquisition intensified, and like before, the investigation was limited to lower-level civil servants. Sources of the authority say that despite the complaint, the authority has not been able to proceed with the investigation against the then army chief Rajendra Kshetri, retired chief justice Gopal Parajuli and others. Using the anti-corruption law, the authority led by Ghimire prosecuted about 30 illegal property cases. “But the CIAA acts like the powerful never make mistakes. They show they are working by taking action against low-level employees and do nothing to those with power and political influence,” says former secretary Mukti Rijal. Why do investigations fail? There are many reasons why investigations carried out using the anti-corruption law against big officials fail. Many have learnt from the mistakes of former officials and kept properties and money amassed under the names of relatives. Apart from that, there were also different ways to legalise their assets. After the CIAA took action against the 22 revenue officials, other government staff started to find ways to legalise their assets. Some were so clever that the CIAA found nothing in their houses. “We had so many complaints against  Bijaya Gachhadhar , but had no proof,” says a former CIAA official. Former Nepal Oil Corporation chief Digambar Jha was another one that got away from the CIAA officials who say he always got appointed to high-ranking positions using his political sources.  “We investigated his property details but got nothing. I don’t know why,” says the official. Officials of the authority accept that the informal economy that has grown in recent times, land transactions and its price increase make it easy for people to legalise their assets and earnings notwithstanding the anti-corruption law.

"Politics-crime nexus in Nepal: What are the causes, consequences and remedies?","Nepal, like any other developing country, has been grappling with the issue of the politics-crime nexus for years. It has become a significant political phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for the country’s stability and development. The weak governance and political instability in Nepal have also contributed to the rise of crime as a political phenomenon. There is a need for a concerted effort by the government, political parties, civil society, and international partners as the politics-crime nexus has been a major impediment to the country’s stability and development. Understanding the nexus In recent years, Nepal has witnessed a rise in criminal activities including organised crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and corruption. These crimes not only pose a threat to public safety but also undermine the rule of law and democracy in the country. But, more problematically, political leaders have often used their power and influence to protect their interests and those of their supporters, leading to the proliferation of crime, corruption and impunity. The  politicisation of crime and corruption  has also been a significant challenge in Nepal. Political parties have been accused of using criminal elements to further their political agendas. This has resulted in the entrenchment of criminal networks in the political establishment, further weakening the rule of law and democratic institutions. While tracking the politics-crime nexus in Nepal, so many examples can be found including the  murder of media personality Jamim Shah in 2010 , the alleged  political nexus of trader Ajaya Sumargi  and the  2018 gold smuggling case  led by Chudamani Upreti aka Gore.  Similarly, in 2019,  a member of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP)  was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of a rival party member. The accused was a close aide to a powerful politician and had been reportedly involved in a long-standing feud with the victim. The notorious  Lalita Niwas land scam  is another paramount example. Considering everything as it is, it is safe to say the politics-crime nexus will continue in Nepal in the upcoming years also. The impact The politics-crime nexus in Nepal has not only weakened the rule of law but has also undermined the country’s reputation on the global stage, making it difficult to attract foreign investment and support. These unholy ties had significant implications for the country’s international relations. The examples of the  Jamim Shah murder case  and the gold smuggling case serve as a stark reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in the government and political establishment. Examples of the politics-crime nexus in Nepal show powerful politicians and leaders often use their positions to engage in illegal activities and exploit their power for personal gain. This highlights the need for stronger anti-corruption measures and the importance of holding public officials accountable for their actions. Remedies The politics-crime nexus as a political phenomenon can be addressed in Nepal through various measures.  Firstly, there should be a strict implementation of anti-corruption laws and regulations. This can be done by strengthening the capacities of the anti-corruption agencies and ensuring their independence from political interference. Additionally, there should be strict monitoring and investigation of political funding and expenditure to prevent the misuse of public funds for illegal activities. Secondly, there should be a culture of transparency and accountability in politics. This can be achieved by promoting political education and civic engagement, empowering civil society organisations to monitor political activities, and encouraging media freedom and investigative journalism. Thirdly, there should be a reform of the political system to make it more inclusive and responsive to the needs of the people. This can be done by promoting electoral reforms, strengthening local governance, and ensuring the representation of marginalised communities in decision-making processes. Overall, addressing the politics-crime nexus in Nepal requires a multi-faceted approach that involves legal, institutional, and social reforms. It requires the commitment of political leaders, civil society organisations, and the general public to promote a culture of transparency, accountability, and respect for the rule of law.",political

Nepal presidential election: 6 things you should know,"In 2022, Nepal concluded local, provincial and federal elections. The public actively participated in all three elections that witnessed  various interesting events  ranging from  the rise of independent candidates . Now is the time for Nepal presidential election,  scheduled for March 9 .  This means the second tenure of  President Bidya Devi Bhandari  is about to end, and Nepal is going to get a new head of state. According to  Nepal’s constitution , a person who has already been elected twice as the president shall not be eligible to be a candidate again. The procedure of the Nepal presidential election is quite complex as it is different from the elections in general. So, you might get in trouble understanding the process. But, don’t worry–we have got you covered. 1. The voters This is the first thing why the Nepal presidential election is different from the rest of the elections that happen in Nepal. The general public is not allowed to cast their votes for the president. Instead, the electoral college includes all members of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly of the federal parliament and members of all seven provincial parliaments, as per article 62 of the constitution.  Accordingly, there will be a total of 884 members including 275 members of the House of Representatives (Lower House), 59 members of the National Assembly (Upper House) and 550 members of seven provincial assemblies. 2. The mathematics  Counting votes by the electoral college members is perhaps the most intriguing part of the Nepal presidential election because the members have different weights assigned to their votes.  A vote cast by a member of the federal parliament, including both upper and lower houses, will be considered to have a weight of 79 votes whereas a vote cast by a member of a provincial assembly will be considered to have a weight of 48 votes. It means, there will be a total of 52,786 electoral votes in the electoral college. The weight of the vote has been decided according to the ratio of lawmakers to the total population of the country as calculated in the 2011 census as the final report of the latest 2021 population census is  not yet out .    A person who secures more than 50 per cent of the total votes in the voting of the Nepal presidential election shall be elected as the president.  3. The provision of revoting In case none of the candidates secures more than 50 per cent of the total votes, there will be revoting between the top two candidates to conclude the Nepal presidential election.  If the candidate cannot secure over 50 per cent of votes in the second round, the voting will step into the third round.  In the third round, the candidate securing the highest number of valid votes will be elected as the president. 4. The trouble of the tie According to the Act on Presidential and Vice Presidential Elections, in case two candidates secure equal vote weights, the Nepal presidential election will be concluded through the lucky draw (drawing of lots).  5. Key dates  The Election Commission has published a calendar for the Nepal presidential election, according to which the key election activities will take place on the following dates: 6. Qualification of the candidates No parties have yet decided the name of the candidates for the presidential election. The parties are still discussing on it. However, to select the candidates for the Nepal presidential election, there are few criteria that the political parties have to follow. Firstly, the candidate should hold Nepali citizenship based on descent. Secondly, the candidate should be over 45 years old. The candidate’s name also should be registered in the latest electoral roll of the rural municipality or municipality.  Similarly, the candidate should not be ineligible by any law and s/he should not hold any position of profit.  Lastly, the presidential candidate must have 25 members of the electoral college as proposers and 25 others as seconders to file nominations.",political
New Nepal president? Perhaps it’s one between Madhav Kumar Nepal and Ram Chandra Paudel,"Kathmandu, February 21 The race is getting narrower as the  Nepal presidential election date  is getting closer. While parties continue efforts to turn the tables on their favours, as of Monday evening, it seems Ram Chandra Paudel and Madhav Kumar Nepal will be the final contestants for the country’s top position.  Ram Chandra Paudel of the Nepali Congress was an ongoing story for the last few weeks. But, on Monday, leaders of different political parties revealed that CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli is trying to field his former comrade and CPN-Unified Socialist leader Madhav Kumar Nepal for the presidential election. This is not an easy choice for Oli as his ties with Nepal have reached the lowest for the past two years. But, he is compromising so as to block the Nepali Congress candidate from winning the election, say negotiators. Of late, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN-Maoist Centre has been hinting that it would not support the UML candidate for the Nepal presidential election as it is  pressing for “national consensus.”  There are also reports that he has  already assured the Nepali Congress  of its support if the party can bring every other party–but the UML–on board.  It means Oli is convinced that the UML will not be able to win the presidential race. Now, he has hope that if he fields former PM Madhav Kumar Nepal on his behalf, it will put pressure on the Maoist Centre–and even the Congress–to rethink. As of now, both the Congress and Nepal’s Unified Socialist are in the same position; they have given the confidence vote to PM Dahal but claim to be the opposition parties.",political
PM Dahal has assured the Nepali Congress of backing its presidential candidate: Negotiators,"Kathmandu, February 20 Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has already assured the Nepali Congress of backing its presidential candidate in the election to  elect the country’s top official on March 9 . Negotiators say Dahal has even informed CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli that the CPN-Maoist Centre will not vote for the UML’s candidate as agreed between the two parties in December 2022 while  nominating Dahal as the prime minister . The Maoist Centre of late has been saying it would try to build a national consensus on the presidential candidate, which many people believe refers to the Nepali Congress candidate after Dahal got the  vote of confidence from almost all parties .  On Sunday night, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and leaders Purna Bahadur Khadka, Krishna Prasad Sitaula and Gagan Thapa met Prime Minister Dahal in their bid to finalise the deal. However, it could not be official as the Maoist Centre delayed the negotiation saying it would make an official decision from the central committee first. “It’s certain that the old alliance [consisting of the Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre and Unified Socialist among others]  will revive . This will be official once the Maoists make a decision,” a negotiator says.",political
How civil society organisations can contribute to Nepal’s delayed transitional justice process?,"Transitional justice in Nepal refers to the efforts made to address the human rights violations and crimes committed during the country’s  decade-long armed conflict  (from 1996 to 2006). The war fought between the Nepali government and the Maoist rebels resulted in the deaths of around 17,000 people and the displacement of many more. To address the human rights abuses committed during the conflict, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in 2006, which established the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission  (TRC) and the  Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons  (CIEDP). The TRC and CIEDP were established with the Enforced Disappearances Inquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, 2014, with the aim of investigating the human rights violations committed during the conflict, providing reparations to the victims, and promoting reconciliation between the conflicting parties.  However, the work of these commissions has been criticised for being slow, inefficient, and lacking in transparency. Many survivors and human rights organisations have accused the Nepali government of neglecting the issue of transitional justice, resulting in  a lack of progress towards reconciliation and justice . One of the critics of the country’s slow transitional justice process has been civil society organisations that also demand several amendments from time to time. While their concerns seem genuine, it is also about time they also realised their constructive roles in the process and made their due contributions. If that happens, there is hope that with continued efforts, the country can move towards a more just and peaceful future. Playing the constructive role Civil society organizations (CSOs) play an important role in the country’s transitional justice process by promoting sustained peace, preventing the occurrence of conflicts, and providing psychosocial support to the survivors of violence. The CSOs act as intermediaries between communities and the government and can help to ensure that the needs and concerns of marginalised groups are heard and addressed.  Here are some specific ways that CSOs can contribute to these transitional justice goals:  The CSOs work with communities to identify potential sources of conflict and develop strategies to prevent them. This may involve promoting dialogue and understanding between different groups, advocating for policies that address the root causes of conflict and building the capacity of local organisations to prevent and manage conflicts.  The CSOs also work to build sustainable peace by promoting social cohesion and reconciliation between conflicting groups. This may involve supporting peace education initiatives, facilitating inter-group dialogues, and promoting initiatives that promote reconciliation and healing. : Women were particularly affected by the conflict, and their  psychosocial and mental health continues to be impacted  by the experiences they endured during this period. During the conflict, women were subjected to physical and sexual violence, including rape and torture, both by the Maoist rebels and the government security forces. Unfortunately, access to mental health services remains limited in Nepal, particularly in rural areas where the conflict was most intense. Women who do seek help for their mental health concerns often face stigma and discrimination, as mental illness is still widely misunderstood and stigmatised in Nepali society. The CSOs can intervene and bridge the gap in this situation.  The CSOs can also play an important role in advocating for policies and programmes that promote sustainable peace and support the survivors of violence. This may involve advocating for legal reforms, pushing for increased government support for peacebuilding initiatives, and lobbying for increased funding for psychosocial support programmes. Policy provisions and efforts In 2016, the National Action Plan ( NAP I ) for Transitional Justice in Nepal was developed under the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction on Implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820. The NAP I was developed by the government of Nepal in consultation with civil society, survivors, and international stakeholders, and was launched in 2011. The plan aimed to provide a comprehensive framework for addressing past abuses and promoting transitional justice in Nepal. It included four major components: truth-seeking, justice, reparations, and institutional reforms.  However, the implementation of NAP I faced various challenges, including a lack of political will, a lack of resources, and bureaucratic hurdles. In 2015, a new government was formed. Then, the implementation of NAP I was postponed, and a new action plan (NAP II) was developed in 2018, which was also focused on memorialisation, along with four previous focuses. In all these stages, civil society organisations have played a significant role and it should continue in the years to come.  Transitional justice is a complex and challenging process, and Nepal has faced many obstacles in implementing it. Political instability and a lack of political will have been major challenges in implementing transitional justice in Nepal. The frequent changes in government and the lack of consensus on how to address past human rights violations have led to delays and a lack of progress. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and nuanced approach that promotes public awareness, strengthens the legal framework, increases resources and survivor participation, fosters collaboration, and promotes reconciliation. CSOs can facilitate each and every aspect of the process.",political
Presidential pardon releases Nagarik Unmukti Party MP Arun Kumar Chaudhary,"Kathmandu, February 19 Nagarik Unmukti Party lawmaker Arun Kumar Chaudhary, who was  sent to jail  in the first week of February to serve a six-month jail sentence ordered by the  Kailali District Court  some 13 years ago, has received the presidential pardon. Following the pardon announced on Friday, Chaudhary was released from the Kailali District Jail on Sunday in the presence of his party chairperson, lawmaker Ranjita Shrestha.  After getting free from jail, Chaudhary said he was arrested to take some political revenge, without naming who wanted to take revenge on him. “The way our small party is growing, they wanted to shrink it back. This is not good,” he said.  Although section 155 of the  National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 , allows people sentenced to less than one year of imprisonment to skip the sentence by paying an additional fine, Chaudhary had not chosen the option. Recently, it has been found that the court some 13 years ago convicted Arun Kumar Chaudhary, Parshuram Chaudhary, and Bir Bahadur Chaudhary of setting a tractor on fire. Besides the jail sentence, they were ordered to pay Rs 875,000 in fines. Arun Kumar Chaudhary was elected to the House of Representatives to represent Kailali 2 in the general elections  held in November 2022 .",political
Nepal’s vice president Nanda Bahadur Pun has nothing but frustration as he leaves office,"Nepal’s vice president Nanda Bahadur Pun is frustrated. For the past seven years, he has felt disrespected by various government bodies, private organisations and even the parliament. “They send me an invitation, but they don’t even get the address right. How careless is that,” he says. “Even the parliament sends a normal staff member to invite me to events when according to the law, I should have been invited by the speaker, deputy speaker or the general secretary of the parliament.” After serving two terms , Pun is leaving the Green House. And during his time, he has seen it all which has made him realise how poorly a person who is the  vice president of the country  has been treated. The ignored institution After Nepal was declared a republic in 2008, the country got a president as the head of state and a vice president to perform the duties in the absence of the president. While the president has got a permanent home and office at Sheetal Niwas, the vice president on the other hand has not been fortunate enough. Contrary to the president, the vice president’s office and residence were in different places initially. The office was in the building of the  Election Commission  while their residence was further away in Lainchaur. The first vice president Paramananda Jha had complained to the government that he had found it difficult as neither his residence nor his office was spacious enough. Jha left the office on October 27, 2015, and was replaced by Pun, who had the same issues. Pun, like Jha, also had to work and live in different places which he said was inconvenient. He also complained and the government then found a spacious place previously housed by the Social Welfare Council, painted it green and called it the Green House.  Pun moved there on May 1, 2019. Restricted roles Now, as the vice president has a spacious building to live and work in, people are debating if his jurisdiction should also be expanded as many people claim he does not have enough jobs to do. But,  the constitution of Nepal  does not allow that to happen. The role of the vice president, according to the constitution, is to fulfil the roles of the president when they are not in the country. If the president is active, the vice president has nothing to do. Vice President Pun has engaged himself in activities such as participating in the programs held by social organisations. According to the Vice President’s Office, Pun has played the role of acting president 12 times in the past seven years. Since the vice president does not have much to do, many people have suggested their role be broadened by making them the chair of the National Assembly and chancellor of the universities. Cordiality and controversies During the past seven years, Vice President Pun has always acted cordially. When KP Sharma Oli dissolved the House, Pun even questioned the move and condemned Oli publicly. Following that, Oli and Pun even had a verbal argument during a Democracy Day programme at Tundikhel. “Are you trying to play politics?” Oli asked Pun, according to a leader who attended the programme. Oli further told Pun why he was trying to oppose him to which Pun questioned Oli if as prime minister, he could do as he pleased. “If you’re trying to oppose me, I’ll remember this in the future,” Oli told Pun. TV footage also showed Oli and Pun going at it against one another.  Oli, then, during a gathering in Biratnagar, accused Pun of being politically active. “The vice president is speaking against the government. Can he go on making public remarks about the government?” he said. People close to Pun say he did what his post required him of doing at a specific time.  “The constitution has given him the responsibility to do that as what Oli had done was unconstitutional,” says a leader close to Pun. What he did was proved right when the Supreme Court reinstated the House and deemed Oli was wrong. From active politics to passive position Nanda Bahadur Pun’s political career has been a long one, full of ups and downs. He has written it all in his upcoming autobiography called Yatra Jingadima covers his childhood, the military attack he led during the  Maoist war , his entry into mainstream politics and his experiences as the vice president for two terms. Pun’s close associates who were close to him during the war are Barsha Man Pun, Jarnadan Sharma and Chakrapani Khanal. Unlike his close aides, Pun was bounded to a ceremonial post while the rest are actively involved in party politics. Following the end of their term, the first president Ram Baran Yadav and the first vice president Paramananda Jha did not return to active politics. They often participate in social work. What next? The constitution of Nepal provides that the president and vice president cannot be elected for more than two terms. According to that, Pun cannot become the vice president again, but the option of becoming the president is open to him. His family members say he is the right person to become the president too as he has the right character and experience. “This tenure has been without any controversy. He’s the perfect one,” said his family member. Pun had aspired to be the president, but the Maoist Centre agreed to make UML’s Bidya Devi Bhandari the president. Even though the Maoists are leading the government, it is unlikely that it will push its candidate for the position. But if the Maoists do nominate a candidate, Pun will be on top of the list despite Baburam Bhattarai also aspiring to become the president. While there is an argument going on among the Maoists that it is not appropriate for a person who has been the prime minister to claim the presidency, it will be difficult for the leadership to reject Pun if he wants to become the president. The UML has claimed the president to be from the party given it has given Pushpa Kamal Dahal the chance to become the prime minister. But now, with the  Nepali Congress also giving Dahal the vote of confidence , there is a feeling among the Maoist Centre that the person who is made president should be accepted by everyone in the country. A member of Pun’s private secretariat says that the retiring vice president will not be involved in active politics. “He is thinking about what to do next. He will not return to active politics. It means involvement in a different kind of social service,” he says. This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Nepal Democracy Day: 7 facts about 1951 revolution,"Today is the National Democracy Day in Nepal. On this day, Nepal welcomed democracy for the first time. This was the result of a revolution.  This was a political movement against the tyrannical Rana regime that eventually resulted in the end of the 104-year-long Rana rule in the country. Let’s celebrate this Democracy day that marked the awakening of the democratic movements in Nepal, by learning some of the facts that revolved around it: It is an open secret that Kind Tribhuvan always had an anti-Rana attitude and wanted to overthrow the Ranas from power. Hence, he also worked with Nepal Praja Parishad, a political party formed under the leadership of Tanka Prasad Acharya to remove the Rana dictatorship. In the very process, King Tribhuvan along with his family took refuge in the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu in November 1950. Only Prince Gyanendra, a grandson of King Tribhuvan, was left in the palace. At that time, Mohan Shamsher JBR was the prime minister of Nepal.  Then, on November 10, 1950, King Tribhuvan accompanied by his family  fled to New Delhi  on two Indian military planes from the Indian Embassy. Being infuriated by the move of King Tribhuvan, Mohan Shamsher JBR called an emergency cabinet meeting on November 7, 1950, in Singha Durbar and declared the three-year-old Prince Gyanendra as the new king of the country. He was enthroned during a function at the Hanuman Dhoka Palace the same day. However, many countries including India, the UK, and the USA refused to recognise the new king of Nepal. On the same day when child Prince Gyanendra was crowned as the new king, mass demonstrations and protests against this act started in every corner of the country including the Kathmandu valley.  Also, the Mukti Sena, the military wing of the Nepali Congress party, also known as the liberation army of the Nepali Congress, started an armed revolt against the Rana regime. They were successful in taking control of many places in Terai. King Tribhuvan was formally welcomed in the capital of India by the Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, and other high-ranking officials. After some months in the third round of negotiations, a tripartite agreement was signed in New Delhi among the Ranas,  Nepali Congress , and King Tribhuvan. Later, it was known as the Delhi Accord. In the accord, the three parties agreed to create a democratic constitution within two years by an elected constituent assembly, to not restrict any political organisations, to free the political prisoners, to hand over all the arms and ammunitions to the governments, and to make an interim cabinet having 10 ministers, five from Nepali Congress and the remaining half from the Ranas under the premiership of Mohan Shamsher and the ultimate power lies in the monarch. Following the agreement, on February 15, 1951, King Tribhuvan returned to Nepal as the head of the state along with the leading members of the Nepali Congress party. They were welcomed and cheered by a huge flock of supporters.  On February 18, 1951, King Tribhuvan declared Nepal’s first steps to democracy with a historical proclamation. After that, this day is celebrated as Democracy Day. Also, a cabinet was formed headed by Mohan Shamsher JBR including the members of the Rana family and the Nepali Congress Party.  Even after the end of the Rana regime, Mohan Shamsher JBR headed the cabinet as the Prime Minister of the country and was also able to enact the new constitution named the Interim Government of Nepal Act, 1951 until November 16, 1951.",political
Nepali politics is known for irresponsibility. It’s high time it focused on people’s expectations,"Corrupt politics and bad governance have been persistent issues in Nepali politics for many years. The political leaders, instead of serving the people, have been using their positions for their own personal gain. This has resulted in widespread corruption, where public funds are misused, contracts are awarded to unqualified individuals, and laws are flouted with impunity. Corruption has deeply ingrained itself in the system, and it has become increasingly difficult to root it out. The present  CPN-Maoist Centre-led government  is still failing to create hope and confidence among citizens. This government is formed just after the national elections, so naturally, people expected much more reform, correction, and delivery from the new government. But, unfortunately, until yet, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal cannot assure what it wants to accomplish in which ways and how the government functionaries will be mobilised to address the pertinent challenges of the nation. Prime Minister Dahal is wasting valuable time on filthy political games of parliamentary practices.  Now, it’s high time the leaders in Nepali politics corrected themselves and focused on national development and other people’s expectations. Need for accountability and transparency Bad governance is a major concern in Nepali politics as the political leaders have failed to provide basic services to the citizens. There is a lack of accountability and transparency in the government, which has resulted in poor management of public resources.  The political leaders have also been unable to address the pressing issues facing the country, such as poverty, unemployment, and poor infrastructure. The lack of effective leadership and governance has also led to widespread social unrest and instability, further hindering the country’s development and progress. Nepali politicians have a long history of putting their personal interests ahead of the nation. For instance, much-needed development projects like building roads, bridges and airports have been delayed for years because of political wrangling. The leaders have been more concerned about securing their own positions and enriching themselves, rather than working towards the betterment of the country and its citizens. Moreover, corruption is rampant in Nepali politics. Politicians are involved in the embezzlement of public funds and abuse of power, which has seriously hindered the economic development of the country.  The lack of accountability and transparency in the political system has resulted in a lack of trust among the citizens and has also made it difficult for foreign investors to have confidence in the country’s business environment. Need for learning from failures Major actors in Nepali politics have been unable to come to a consensus on important issues affecting the country’s economy. For example, the government has been unable to implement much-needed reforms in the energy sector and investment areas.  These not only affect the daily lives of citizens but also has a negative impact on the country’s businesses and industries, causing significant economic losses. Politicians have failed to prioritise national interest and economic development.  The lack of seriousness and commitment towards these issues is one of the main reasons why the country has failed to progress and improve the lives of its citizens. Until the politicians start putting the nation’s interests first, the country will continue to struggle with economic and social issues. The failure of Nepali politics to control the  high prices of essential goods and services  has been a major source of concern for the citizens. Despite efforts to curb inflation, the prices of basic necessities such as food, fuel, and medicine continue to rise, putting a strain on the already struggling households. The government’s inability to address this issue effectively has resulted in widespread poverty and hardship for many citizens. The corrupt bureaucracy in Nepal has been a hindrance to the country’s development and progress. The bureaucrats are known for demanding bribes, engaging in nepotism, and ignoring the needs of the citizens.  The corruption has resulted in inefficiencies in the delivery of public services and has also made it difficult for businesses to operate in the country. The inability of Nepali politics to address this issue has resulted in widespread frustration and disillusionment among the citizens, further eroding the trust in the political system. What’s next? To maintain economic development, increase investment and accelerate good governance, the current Dahal-led government can take several steps and set itself as an example in Nepali politics.  Firstly, it is important to create a stable and predictable business environment that will attract foreign investors. This can be achieved by implementing transparent and effective regulations, streamlining the bureaucracy, and reducing corruption. For instance, countries like Singapore and South Korea have implemented effective measures to curb corruption, and as a result, they have become attractive destinations for foreign investment. Another key factor in maintaining economic development and increasing investment is prioritising  infrastructure development . This includes building roads, bridges, airports, and other essential facilities that are required for business and commerce.  The government can also invest in education and healthcare to create a skilled workforce that can support the country’s economic growth. For example, countries like China and India have seen significant economic growth after investing heavily in infrastructure and human capital. Nepali politics must address the issues of poverty and unemployment by creating job opportunities and improving the standard of living for the citizens. This can be achieved by promoting entrepreneurship and small businesses, as well as investing in agriculture and rural development. For instance, countries like Bangladesh and Ethiopia have seen significant economic growth by focusing on the development of small businesses and rural areas. The government must also ensure that the benefits of economic growth are inclusive and reach the most vulnerable sections of society. It is essential for major actors in Nepali politics to focus on the needs and demands of the people if it wants to maintain economic development and promote good governance. The government must prioritise the basic needs of the citizens such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education, and take necessary steps to address these issues. By doing so, the government will create a more stable and supportive environment for the citizens, which in turn, will lead to greater well-being and happiness. Moreover, the government must avoid wasting time and resources on unnecessary factors that do not directly benefit the citizens. Instead, it should concentrate on the key issues that affect the lives of the people, such as poverty, unemployment, and the high cost of living. By focusing on these priorities, the government will be able to create real and tangible benefits for the citizens and earn their trust and support.",political
"Prithvi Jayanti, Maoist war anniversary are included in govt’s annual public holiday calendar","Kathmandu, February 17 The government has decided to include Prithvi Jayanti and the Maoist war (so-called People’s War) holidays in the annual public holiday calendar for the Bikram Sambat 2080 beginning in mid-April 2023.

Germany supports Nepal with 1.5 million Covid-19 vaccines through COVAX,"Kathmandu, February 16 Germany handed over more than 1.5 million doses of  Pfizer-BioNTech’s bivalent Covid-19 vaccine  to Nepal through the COVAX initiative.  German Ambassador to Nepal, Thomas Prinz, gave the vaccines to the  Minister for Health and Population  Padam Giri at the Ministry on Wednesday. Present with Prinz were UNICEF Representative to Nepal Elke Wisch and WHO Representative to Nepal  Rajesh Sambhajirao Pandav. “From the beginning of this pandemic, Germany has supported the people of Nepal and has advocated for multilateral solutions like COVAX and ACT-Accelerator. Vaccines are key in the fight against this pandemic and I am delighted to hand over today’s vaccines that were invented in Germany,” said Prinz, adding Germany had supported Nepal with 5.6 million doses of vaccines so far Although the number of Covid infections in Nepal is relatively low at present, experts remain concerned about potential new surges in the days to come. So far, over 82 per cent of the total population has been vaccinated, with around 9,08 million having received booster shots. “In light of rising Covid infections in different countries around the world, we are keen to continue administering booster shots and expand protection to more people across Nepal,” said Giri. “This generous assistance from Germany comes at a crucial time to support our vaccination efforts.” The COVAX Facility is part of the ACT-Accelerator, and brings together several key partners such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, WHO and UNICEF to ensure efficient and equitable global allocation of Covid-19 vaccines. UNICEF Representative to Nepal Wisch thanked the government and people of Germany for contributing these life-saving vaccines to Nepal. “On behalf of the COVAX facility, we thank the Government of Germany for providing this boost to the country’s ongoing vaccination drive,” said Wisch.",political
Lawmakers to be suspended only if court sends them judicial custody,"Kathmandu, February 16 Members of the  House of Representatives  will be suspended only if they are sent to judicial custody on charges of criminal activities. They will not be suspended if they are charged with criminal activities.

The Maoist and Congress lawmakers said a lawmaker should be suspended in case s/he faces criminal charges. But lawmakers from smaller parties said a lawmaker should not be suspended until the charges were confirmed and s/he was convicted. They argued that lawmakers could face any kind of charges for political revenge. UML lawmakers did not openly share their opinion in the committee, but lawmaker Subas Chandra Nembang said he agreed with lawmakers from smaller parties adding the public consensus was the same. With this, an agreement has been reached in the committee that a lawmaker will be suspended only if they are sent to judicial custody on charges of criminal activities, said a lawmaker present at the committee meeting. Previously,  lawmakers were suspended as soon as criminal charges were filed . In the previous term, Hari Narayan Rauniyar and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar were  suspended after  being charged with corruption . Now, a lawmaker who is sent to judicial custody by the court will be automatically suspended. If the lawmaker is released on bail, the suspension will be lifted.",political

Diagnosing Rabi Lamichhane’s character in relation to his recent tantrum,"When a kid loses his toys, he darts his glance across the surroundings and curses everyone around in frustration. He pays little attention to what he is saying and how his words might affect others. The kid, however, is forgiven keeping into account that he is immature with no control over his feelings and words. When that kid grows a little older, and if he throws tantrums over losing his belongings, people around will give him a sharp stare and might even pin back his ears. With time, his mischief is weighed and a suitable punishment is imposed accordingly so that he realises his mistakes and develops a good character. The very first and basic thing we are taught at an early age is the language and the correct usage of words according to the context. Needless to say, a person’s character is defined by politeness in language, his ability to keep calm, and his behaviour when he is pissed off. And, the recent incident of Rabi Lamichhane venting out  his feelings in public  is one such act by him showing his immaturity and letting down the public’s belief in change. Lamichhane’s stunt  The way Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman  Rabi Lamichhane lashed out at the media  using such coarse language questions his character and the choice of Chitwan residents. He went on blabbering without gauging his words and how they might be perceived by the general public. Thanks to the loyal supporters he has earned by pulling out tricks, they cling to him despite everything. What is interesting is that he disguised  his big blunders  by calling them minor mistakes. He himself said he was spilling out his rage for losing the post of the minister, but his loyal supporters would make no effort to understand this basic thing. Then, they continue to stand by Rabi Lamichhane feeding themselves the hypothesis that everyone is wrong but not their master. Nepali citizens were sick of the old-aged politicians, and the  entry of Lamichhane into politics  was because of the public frustration with the old leaders. Now, the question arises: was it a hasty decision by Chitwan residents to pick him as a representative? Is Lamichhane the idol leader the Chitwan residents and the whole of Nepal wanted?  Lack of maturity and professionalism If Rabi Lamichhane believed he was being ill-treated by the media, he should have navigated through the peaceful way to reach the feet of justice. His violent behaviour only provoked his supporters, and it did not do any good to his prestige. Despite having alternative options to raise his voice, he chose the most violent way. It is because he needed more sympathy from the public and the only way to do it was by going out in the public and accusing the media just because they covered a story on his citizenship issue. Being an ex-journalist himself, why did not he understand that the media are open to raising the issue, and he being a matter of public interest, the media coverage about his citizenship issues is obvious? Why Rabi Lamichhane fails to understand that politics is a matter of patience and that one cannot run long unless he is mentally robust? However, in his case, mental toughness comes later because he needs to fix his character in the first place. A good character does not label someone as a “joker” and does not measure anyone’s intellectual height with the width of the underwear. The whole nation was keeping an eye on him when he labelled Rishi Dhamala a “joker”. What is more problematic is that he threatened the media by telling them that he would encircle the media office if anyone wrote against him without clear evidence. If there was a provision for an award for hurling insults, no one would match Rabi Lamichhane. He demanded the wives of media persons come to him and he would expose the real identities of their husbands. What a shameful statement! The most shameful of all allegations, he did not think twice before rattling off the gibberish about what brand of alcohol the media personnel preferred.  If it is not a baseless accusation, what it is? An hour-long press conference he did was a full display of unprofessionalism.  Democracy undermined In a democratic culture, everyone has freedom of speech, but there are limits and one cannot cross the boundary. Just because the public stands before his back, Rabi Lamichhane cannot dismantle his ethics and do whatever that gains him more popularity and sympathy. He needs to understand that he is a political leader, and every citizen in the nation aspires to his leaders and looks upon them. But, is there any good trait that the citizens can learn from him? The answer is no because learning to insult someone will not do any good. Moreover, the most important thing that the public must understand is that politics is a sequential event where current actions are dependent on past actions.  It takes time and patience to change the political landscape. One cannot come and change the politics overnight, and definitely not with a character like Rabi Lamichhane.",political

Maoist Centre to rebrand itself by changing name and election symbol,"Kathmandu, February 10 The CPN-Maoist Centre is preparing to rebrand itself by changing the party name, election symbol and party organisation.

Milan Pandey’s team is back in Bibeksheel Sajha; he might be the next party president,"Kathmandu, February 9 On the eve of the first general convention of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party, its former leader Milan Pandey and his supporters are back in the party. As the general convention will end this weekend, it is likely that Pandey will take over as the party president.

Government attorneys begins investigating Rabi Lamichhane passport case,"Kathmandu, February 9 The  Kathmandu District Government Attorney Office  has begun an investigation in response to a complaint related to the  Rabi Lamichhane passport case . “Today, we opened the case as we decided to call for related documents from the District Administration Office, Department of Immigration and Department of Passports,” a government attorney says, “Once we study the reports, we will forward the Rabi Lamichhane passport case to the police for further investigation.” The Rastriya Swatantra Party chairman is accused of obtaining a Nepali passport based on illegitimate Nepali citizenship in 2015 May. From 2015 until he renounced his US citizenship in 2018, he had passports from two countries; Nepal’s law does not allow this. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that Lamichhane’s old citizenship was cancelled when he migrated to the United States and obtained American citizenship, and he could no more use his old Nepali citizenship certificate. Whereas the verdict had  snatched the powerful deputy prime ministerial position  from Lamichhane, it has been said that  Lamichhane could be barred from contesting any election  if he loses the passport case.",political

In defence of Balen Shah: Why Kathmandu mayor needs your support now,"In the local elections last year, the people of Kathmandu  voted for Balen Shah  for the  capital city ‘s mayor, whom many people had thought would lose the elections as an independent candidate. The people of Kathmandu had high expectations of him after his win. Apparently, it was a revolution that resulted in many young candidates winning the federal and provincial elections held in November of the same year.  However, Shah, of late,  has faced criticism  for several of his projects. But, this is the time for general people to understand his intentions and limitations and be hopeful about the future. They need to support him and his agenda. Balen Shah’s priorities and projects The first thing Balen Shah focused on was the problem of pedestrian pavement encroachment. Being the mayor of Kathmandu, his first responsibility is the well-being of his voters. He was right that all people should walk freely. Those who want to do business should rent a shop, pay taxes and do business. What’s wrong with that? But, many prominent individuals criticised the mayor for that. In Kathmandu, there are not many open spaces to  manage street vendors . So, what is the role of the provincial and central governments? Is it not their duty to relocate them? Then comes the never-ending problem of waste management. We have known that it is a chronic problem, which cannot be managed overnight. Yet,  Balen Shah has made some efforts  and we should appreciate that. It is not the only problem of Kathmandu but other municipalities too. Still being an engineer and mayor of Kathmandu, he is taking lead to manage waste, but neither provincial nor central governments are helping to find suitable land fields. So the question is: is it only the responsibility of the mayor? Likewise, all major metropolitan cities around the world have underground metro and parking. Shah wishes to make  underground parking in areas like Khulamanch , but a handful of  people are against it . It does not mean he should stop developmental work. With population growth, the number of people and vehicles has increased significantly, so it is natural to widen the roads, but few politicians are against it. They were silent when illegal constructions of general people were removed but became violent when their constructions were removed. These illegal constructions were cleared according to law and at the local people’s request. What is wrong with that? The problem of being Balen Shah Mental pain might be less dramatic than physical pain, but it is harder to bear. Although Mayor Balen Shah has not publicly stated it, it appears to have affected him directly or indirectly. He and his family might have got many threatening calls and abusive messages.  At present, it seems only metropolitan police are actively working and supporting the mayor. What about other departments? Their work or feedback is not seen on the ground. Mayors may set policies, but it is equally important to put those policies into action and monitor the results. Otherwise, the situation will be much like the one in which many construction companies have failed to finish building roads or bridges for many years. Government staff members who are in charge of that particular task should adhere to these.  Meanwhile, Balen Shah’s team has also  not received sufficient support  from the central government.  We just blame the politicians, but the staff are also as accountable for the current state of our nation today. Despite being surrounded by numerous people, the independent mayor is lonely. No one escapes pain, fear, and suffering.  The show must go on Yet, from pain can come wisdom, from fear can come courage, and from suffering can come strength — if we have the virtue of resilience. Let’s hope Mayor Balen Shah develops wisdom, courage and more strength. Our system has three layers of government, and it is the collective responsibility of all to make Kathmandu better. He is making every effort for the development of Kathmandu, but a few people are creating hindrances.  But, we all need to know that if he fails, the country will suffer.",political

Rabi Lamichhane citizenship-passport controversy: Your 7 FAQs answered,"Rabi Lamichhane’s political career has been nothing but a roller coaster. Having made a name as a television presenter, Lamichhane  jumped into politics  forming the  Rastriya Swatantra Party  and proved many people wrong by winning the 20 seats in the 2022 general elections. Following their success in the elections, Lamichhane and his party even joined the ruling coalition and he became the country’s home minister. But things took an ugly turn for him last Friday when the  Supreme Court scraped his parliament and cabinet membership  for not obtaining Nepali citizenship after renouncing his American citizenship. Wanting to make things right, Lamichhane, on Sunday,  obtained his Nepali citizenship  by following the due procedure. So, what went wrong for him? Why did the court give such a verdict? What does it mean for his party and what next for Mr Popular?  Here, we try to explain the curious case of Rabi Lamichhane. After spending a few years in the US, Rabi Lamichhane became a US citizen. According to section 10(1) of the  Nepal Citizenship Act , 2006, once a Nepali national voluntarily decides to become a citizen of another country, his/her citizenship is automatically void. That is what happened to Lamichhane when he became a US citizen. There is no dispute that Lamichhane renounced his US citizenship in 2018. But, the Supreme Court ruled that Lamichhane did not complete the process to regain Nepali citizenship. According to the Supreme Court, after he renounced his US citizenship, he did not submit the application with the details to the District Administration Office, due to which his citizenship was not valid. No, the Supreme Court did not say he is not a Nepali citizen. The court only said he was eligible to become a Nepali citizen again, but he did not fulfil the procedure to get his citizenship again.  He had to be released from the position of lawmaker and home minister obtained through the use of political rights because he did not get the citizenship certificate. A lawyer who pleaded against Lamichhane says, “He was qualified to get a citizenship certificate, but he didn’t get one. This made him look like someone else, which is wrong.” No. He will not be reinstated. Since the old citizenship certificate submitted to the Election Commission during the election nomination process was not legal, and he became a lawmaker and home minister based on that, he cannot be reinstated. After taking his citizenship again on Sunday, he can enjoy all the rights like other Nepalis. To become a lawmaker again, he will have to go through the election process again. Lamichhane took Nepali citizenship in 1994 on the basis of descent. On Sunday, he got back his old citizenship, which was considered illegal after he obtained his US citizenship. It means the citizenship will be equally valid. This is unclear. He has been removed from the political positions he obtained using an illegal citizenship certificate. But some legal practitioners who are in his favour claim this is not enough to convict him. But, lawyers who are arguing the case against Lamichhane say that he should not be exempted from the prevailing law as he cheated the state by doing so. According to the claim of those lawyers, he participated in the election as a Nepali citizen and won. His name was included in the voter’s list based on his illegal citizenship. As the home minister, he has access to sensitive information about the state. “He should be punished according to law because he has deceived the state. He should be convicted,” says a lawyer. Rabi Lamichhane got his US citizenship in 2014. After returning to Nepal, he joined the media and became a popular television personality.  After getting into controversy, he renounced his US citizenship from Nepal in 2018. But prior to that, Lamichhane, in 2015, obtained a Nepali passport using his Nepali citizenship that was already void. From 2015 until he renounced his US citizenship in 2018, he seems to have passports from two countries. Nepal’s law does not allow this to happen. Section 21(a) of the Passport Act, 2019, states that if a passport is obtained by giving false information, it is deemed to be an offence. If it is confirmed that Lamichhane lied, the act provides for a fine of up to Rs 500,000 or imprisonment for 1 to 3 years or both. A complaint asking to investigate Lamichhane for his obtaining his passport illegally is also under consideration at the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. The DAO has sent the complaint to the police for investigation. It means the investigation about his passport will go on regardless of him getting back Nepali citizenship.

Rabi Lamichhane obtains Nepali citizenship,"Kathmandu, January 29 Former deputy prime minister Rabi Lamichhane obtained the Nepali citizenship again on Sunday.

"Rabi Lamichhane citizenship row: Court scraps parliament, cabinet membership","Kathmandu, January 27 The Supreme Court has scrapped the lawmaker’s status of Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane. A constitutional bench led by Acting Chief Justice Hari Krishna Karki issued the verdict Friday. The verdict reads that Lamichhane was not qualified to contest the  House of Representatives  election as he did not take initiative to obtain Nepali citizenship after renouncing his American citizenship. He handed his resignation to Prime Minister Puspa Kamal Dahal. Resigning as the minister, Lamichhane said that he accepts the court’s verdict. “I have no answers on what I will do next,” he said. Rabi Lamichhane, a former  television personality  rose into politics in the 2022 general elections. He had formed  Rastriya Swatantra Party to contest the election . He contested and won from Chitwan 2. Before the election, a writ petition was filed against him claiming he wasn’t a Nepali citizen asking the Election Commission to void his candidacy. This verdict means a byelection will take place in Chitwan 2 to fill the post left vacant after Lamichhane’s removal.  Following his removal as a lawmaker, Lamichhane will also no longer remain the chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The party however will remain even though Lamichhane had registered it using his illegal citizenship.",political

"Victoria Nuland, high US official, visiting Nepal soon","Kathmandu, January 25 Victoria Nuland , the United States undersecretary of state for political affairs, is preparing to visit Nepal within the next few weeks–making herself the first American high official to visit Nepal after the  formation of the new government here . In recent years, the frequency of visits of diplomats from the US is continuously rising, which for some is a hint of a  shift in Nepal’s foreign relations priorities  as well as the growing geopolitical importance of Nepal in the international community. While both the Nepali and American sides confirmed the plan for the visit, no one has officially announced the date of the visit yet. “A few other countries are also preparing to send high-level delegations to Nepal soon,” a source at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  says, “Nonetheless, we have not achieved progress to make the schedules public yet.” Officials say  Foreign Minister Bimala Rai Paudyal  and US Ambassador to Nepal Dean R Thompson also discussed the visit plan during a  meeting held on Tuesday .",political
7 things Nepal’s new foreign minister should prioritise,"Bimala Rai Paudyal from the CPN-UML has taken the position of foreign minister of Nepal in the new  Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led cabinet .  It is the foreign minister who works for keeping harmony with foreign countries and maintaining diplomatic relationships. Moreover, in the world scenario, there are various aspects that affect the social and economic aspects of people. Currently, problems such as increasing geopolitical disputes, Russia-Ukraine tension, rising prices, the border dispute between India and China, deteriorating foreign relations, declining foreign investment, and relations between SAARC countries have been affecting the lives of people in Nepal. And all these problems are related to the F oreign Affairs Ministry , hence there are many challenges for the new foreign minister. She needs to deal with the challenges by setting up the right priorities which we will discuss below.  What’s new in the new foreign minister? In Nepal’s political history, it is rare to have a woman lead the key ministries such as home, foreign affairs and finance. As per the Ministry of Foreign Affairs record, Sahana Pradhan and Sujata Koirala took over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2007 and 2009, respectively.  Sushma Swaraj, who was nominated by the Bharatiya Janata Party in India, is the only female foreign minister of India until now. Foreign minister’s challenges and promises The new foreign minister, who was present in the National Assembly in a visible and audible manner, now has a lot to do in a short time. She has to work to strengthen Nepal’s declining international relations and diplomacy by mobilising the ministry’s officials. Today, the country can raise its reputation and its voice only through the proper use of diplomacy. On the day she took over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she said that she would work according to Nepal’s non-aligned foreign policy, make a common policy, discuss with foreign experts, facilitate services to the people, remove the  difficulty in obtaining passports , work in coordination with diplomatic missions, and take advantage without compromising national interests. Narrating the experience of working together with the international missions located there, she said she would prioritise making Nepali feel as safe at home when they enter an embassy of Nepal located abroad. She also said that she would discuss the border dispute with every concerned party. Priorities she should have But, there are several challenges ahead of the new foreign minister in keeping these promises. To do so, the following things should be considered before initiating. Nepal is also suffering from climate change recent plane crash in Pokhara remove it from the blacklist of the European Union border dispute with India EPG report not being accepted Gurkha recruitment dispute suffering of Nepali people at the border",political

Why is Balen Shah running away from questions?,"On August 23, 2022, street vendors reached the office of Kathmandu metropolitan city to submit a memorandum after the city police ordered them to remove their stalls from roads and pedestrian pavements, accusing them of obstructing the smooth movement of the vehicles and pedestrians. However,  Mayor Balen Shah  did not receive the memorandum. As the mayor did not give them time, they peacefully returned to the gate of the metropolis and chanted the slogan “We don’t want a mayor who doesn’t listen to the people.” Shah, who was elected as the mayor in the local elections on May 13, 2022, has been avoiding people since that start as he is not been meeting the general public nor has he been meeting people from the central government. People have started to compare him to the city’s former mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya. But, why is he running away from his accountability to the public? Avoidance rules the city Anuradha Koirala, the founder of Maiti Nepal, did not get to meet Balen Shah either. Why? He told her he did not have time. Following that,  Koirala complained publically . She had gone to meet the mayor as she was concerned about the condition of  former sex workers, most of them are now street vendors , and how their lives have changed after the city government’s decision of removing street vendors without giving them proper alternatives. In June 2022, a National Assembly committee called Shah to answer questions related to the Kathmandu metropolitan city. However, Shah sent his  deputy Sunita Dangol  instead, stating he had no time to attend the meeting.  On November 28, 2022, the city police of the metropolis tried to bulldoze a squatter settlement at Thapathali. The next day, the  squatters who resisted the demolition  went to hand over a memorandum to the mayor. But Shah refused to meet them even though he was at his office. After his refusal, they went back to their settlement and protested. On January 2, 2023, local residents and activists reached the city office demanding that underground parking should not be built under the historic  Khulamanch.  However, at the last minute, Mayor Balen Shah’s secretariat said that he was busy and informed them that he would not be able to meet anyone until the third week of January. Deputy Mayor Dangol accepted the memorandum and told the activist that underground parking would not be built without public discussion.  But, the activists had taken an appointment with Shah two days before the meeting. However, on the day of the appointment, the mayor’s secretariat informed them Shah was busy as he had gone to meet president Bidya Devi Bhandari. Shah, however, who has been avoiding people, was seen welcoming DRS Gaming who recently  finished second in the PUBG Mobile Global Championships . It is clear that Shah is avoiding people as he does not want to answer questions. When the metropolis held its foundation day on November 21, 2022, Shah did not speak much. Journalists tried to quiz him on issues of public importance, but he did not answer.  Distressing distance An official of the city government says Mayor Balen Shah’s main problem is that he does not understand the sentiments of the people. “He doesn’t think that ordinary people can come to the city office and try to meet the mayor. In his mind, people who come there are mostly brokers, middlemen and contractors,” he says. According to the officer, Shah understands what is wrong with the city as during his election campaign, he went door to door, listening to people’s problems.  If the claims of the employees are to be believed, Shah considers himself to be knowledgeable in most matters. He thinks that it is not appropriate to waste time discussing such matters with the public. In matters he is unaware of, he uses the help of technology to learn about them. “In today’s era, why waste time meeting people to find out something,” says the employee quoting Balen Shah, “When you know how to do the work, why should you sit and discuss with others?” However, it does not mean that a person cannot meet Shah. You just cannot do it the easy way. Sources say Shah can be met through his friend Kumar Byanjankar. Apart from him, the city’s infrastructure consultant Sunil Lamsal and office manager Navin Bhandari can also fix a meeting with Shah. Another example of how far Mayor Shah is trying to distance himself from the public is the unimplemented Mayor with the People programme. The city’s annual policy for the fiscal year 2022/023 mentions “holding a direct dialogue programme with the public on the first Sunday of every month”. However, the metropolis has not run it yet. Balen Shah says that due to the increased workload of the mayor, he could not conduct the programme in public.  “Other programmes were given priority over it,” an official says. But, many city officials say Shah lacks both the strength to listen to criticism and the will to take suggestions. Understanding this trend, Deputy Mayor Dangol expressed her displeasure in the context of Khulamanch by saying that although a decision was made to make a detailed project report (DPR) regarding the issue of underground parking there, it would only be built according to the public’s opinion. The management menace No one, even the city government staff, knows what Shah is busy with. It shows that he lacks managerial skills more than time. Most of the work he had started after being the mayor has not been completed. This is proof of his ad-hocism. For example, he announced that  people needed to segregate waste  before throwing it, but the city has  failed to implement it . He even came up with a plan to remove businesses like shops, restaurants and stores occupying underground parking facilities of commercial buildings. But since  he bulldozed a few , that has also stopped as not many have set up parking there.  Balen Shah’s plan to uncover the Tukucha river also failed when he was asked to  stop doing so  by both the court and the Department of Archeology. The reason? Shah was destroying a tunnel built over a century ago. The part which his officials destroyed is yet to be repaired. The dozer of the metropolis, which was run in Thapathali to remove the riverside squatters against the agreement with the land commission, has now stopped. The plan to remove the slums has been pushed back with the  federal government reluctant to cooperate . The policy of  encouraging private toilets to be used for public use  seems to have failed. Even though the practice has started in limited places, the metropolis has not made an effort to create an environment where the general public will not hesitate to use it. The infrastructure ambulance operated by the metropolis to repair potholes is not working efficiently due to a lack of budget. And, the work of filling the holes is being done in the traditional way through contractors. Even now, Balen Shah is not ready to listen to the voices of the urban poor whose livelihoods have been taken away by the city police on the charge of occupying pavements. But, these pavements, meant for pedestrians, have now become parking spaces for motorbikes and cars. The problems of garbage piled up on the roads, mismanaged public transport, potholed roads, non-operational street lights, blocked drains, dry water sources, and the black market have not touched the mayor. A large section is suffering due to the hasty steps taken by Mayor Balen Shah without adequate discussion, homework and an action plan. Even the works that were being done with the right intentions have been stuck because Shah got caught in controversy. It seems unclear how long the mayor will take hasty decisions without listening to the stakeholders. Even the steps taken with the right intentions have become ineffective when working without assessing the possible consequences. Apathy towards accountability According to the Local Government Operation Act, 2017, there should be three public hearings every fiscal year. In such hearings, the local government should publicly answer the questions asked by the people about its policies, rules, operations and working style. Deepak Adhikari, the assistant spokesperson of the Kathmandu city government, admits that there was no public hearing after Balen Shah assumed office.  “There should be a public hearing on a quarterly basis, but it hasn’t happened,” he says, “We have prepared to hold a public hearing in January.”  But, the stakeholders are not happy. Sanjay Adhikari, an advocate and an expert in conservation law, says, “They are representatives elected by us and people like us. They should be accountable to us.” Federalism and local government expert Dr Khimlal Devkota says that the local governments must be close to the people and leaders such as Balen Shah should not avoid it. “Everyone’s complaints should be heard, you can’t run away from the question,” he says. Krishna Hari Baskota, the former chief commissioner of the National Information Commission, says that no one from the local level and its representatives can avoid the people and their concerns.  “It is a matter of ethics to at least listen to the people by holding a public hearing,” says Baskota, “After being elected by the people, the people in any position must be accountable to the people.” This story was translated from t he original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Baburam Bhattarai: A promising personality lost in the lust for power,"On September 26, 2015, Baburam Bhattarai did the unthinkable. Bhattarai, who had spent most of his adult life as a key leader of the Maoist Centre,  quit the party . His reason? He felt he had been cheated on by other leaders of the party. Leaving the Maoist party, he said he no longer had the thirst for power. He even went on to say how he was running away from power politics and dedicating his life to mission politics. But, he failed to show that in action. Whenever the elections came around, he always went around bargaining for power. When the 2017 elections came around the corner, he  went to the left alliance  and showed his solidarity but the alliance chose Narayan Kaji Shrestha to contest from Bhattarai’s constituency. Following that, Baburam Bhattarai sought support from the Nepali Congress and won the election, but none of his other party members won. This meant he needed an alternative to being a power player, so he  merged his Naya Shakti with Upendra Yadav ’s Samajbadi Party. Following that, he even tried to become the prime minister stating he had 34 lawmakers, but he failed. Knowing he would not be relevant, he  split from Yadav  and was needed to contest the 2022 elections  using the Maoist symbol . This came as a shock to many as he had left the party stating they had betrayed him. But this did make people aware of one thing, Bhattarai would stoop to any level to ensure he could be in a position of power. That attitude of his has lost him the respect of the public and his political followers. Tough times  Since he quit the Maoists seven and a half years ago, Baburam Bhattarai has found it tough. Even though he formed Naya Shakti on June 13, 2016, his political career post-Maoist has been anything but stable. Since then, he has been a part of five different parties. If rumours are true, he is likely to join his sixth party soon. But, Bhattarai sees this differently. In his political document, he writes, “At a glance, the series of party formation and reorganisation may appear rapid in a short period. But from Naya Shakti to Nepal Samajbadi Party, the ideas and agenda are fundamentally the same.” Bhattarai prefers to call a political party a mission with ideas. In his opinion, the party is not an end but a means. He argues that rather than names and numbers, people should look at the ideas, politics and agenda adopted by the party. In his political document, Baburam Bhattarai admits one must be skilled in coordinating strategic steps to achieve strategic objectives. But he does not accept that he did all the running in between for personal interest or gain. Ideological ambiguities In general, Bhattarai has created the image of an ideological leader. However, a leader who has been associated with him for almost seven years considers him ideologically ambiguous. “Having academic intelligence does not mean having ideological clarity. Ideological clarity in politics means protecting the political direction one has taken and standing firm on it. I have not seen that in him,” says the leader on the condition of anonymity. Recalling the example of institutionalising schooling and practice that was once ready to make sacrifices for the defence of the course of action, the leader asks, “How can we assume that a leader who surrenders to compromise and power without protecting the course of action has ideological clarity?” The leader adds, “I didn’t see ideological clarity, a commitment like in the Maoist movement, at the time Baburam Bhattarai left the Maoist Centre.” He tried to fulfil his personal ambitions and called it alternative politics. “But in my eyes, he failed all the tests that came his way,” says the leader. But Bhattarai, in the document, writes that one should not run away from the extremely unfavourable situation that sometimes occurs in politics, but have the courage to face the challenges and risks. He writes that one has to go through the process of many conflicts, tensions, ruptures, alienation, division, unity and reunification in a political career. Reasons to compromise Until the time of his exit from the Janata Samajbadi Party, Baburam Bhattarai seemed to be active in alternative political campaigns. However, pressure from family and his close aides meant he continued to push for power politics and disregarded his motto to be involved in mission politics. But, he continues to call politics his mission. “Politics is a commitment to a certain idea, principle, agenda, a spontaneous interest, and activism towards the nation and state building,” he says. “It is painful and has many ups and downs.” In theory, Baburam Bhattarai is right and understands what needs to be done. In practice, however, he got entangled with each political affiliation he made. He has admitted to this in his document. “A space for intellectual politics is not enough for the establishment and growth of new political parties. You also need appropriate timing,” he writes. “We should have prepared the right base for Naya Shakti Party and not formed it hastily just because the elections were near.” He also admits that the organisation of Naya Shakti was also weak, which led to the idea being automatically weak and the party failing to live up to the expectations. Life comes around in a full circle After seven and a half years, Baburam Bhattarai is returning to the Maoist party. But, he wants to remain coy about it as he says he has not returned to the Maoist and wants to call his new party the CPN-Socialist. The Maoist party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems happy with Bhattarai’s return and has stated how both of their experiments failed. “He formed something new while I tried to join hands with the UML. We both failed,” Dahal says. Bhattarai has admitted in his document that people voted for independent candidates at the local, provincial and federal elections as they did not trust the traditional parties anymore and had disgust towards them. But, the same Bhattarai has seemed to join hands with the same parties he claims that the people no longer trust them. It seems Baburam Bhattarai has left the idea of campaigning to build an alternative political power in a new way and chose to collaborate, polarise and integrate with the closest forces that have similar ideas, policies and programmes. He has agreed to this in his document. “Even though major parties have lost votes this year, we need to understand the parties like Nepali Congress and UML are huge parties,” he writes. “These two have been a constant since Nepal adopted a multiparty democracy in 1991.” But, he feels that the right programme can change the sentiments the youth have against traditional parties.  Whatever Baburam Bhattarai says, after seven and half years, he is back to square one.  This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

"Can Nepal adopt the directly elected presidential system? For now, wait and watch","Nepal has had a number of prime ministers since 2008 when the country adopted a federal democratic system of government. These prime ministers have come from various political parties and have held office for varying lengths of time not exceeding three years at maximum by CPN-UML chairman and former PM KP Sharma Oli. Various pre and post-electoral alliances have failed to deliver as of now and it is always an interesting topic to discuss the potential implications and considerations surrounding a move to the  directly elected presidential system  of governance in Nepal. PM  Pushpa Kamal Dahal  is faced with the difficult decision and question of whether or not to support a shift to the presidential system of government as his party, the CPN-Maoist Centre, has been  advocating for this , albeit not so strongly. Dahal has been described as both an insidious and crafty leader who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, as well as a gentle and pragmatic leader who is able to appease opposing factions and gain the support of the media. In the past, Dahal has expressed interest in becoming the first president of Nepal but has faced ridicule and a lack of support for this proposal. It remains to be seen how Dahal will reconcile these conflicting aspects of his leadership style as he considers the potential consequences of the presidential system for Nepal. It would definitely be a shock if the prime minister tables a constitution amendment proposal any day soon with the current tight political scenario. But, still, whether  Nepal should adopt  the directly elected presidential system is still a matter of debate, and a lot of discussions are required before reaching a conclusion.  Forces to look at Besides the Maoist Centre, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal and a few other political forces have expressed support for the directly elected presidential form of government and the fully proportional electoral system in order to promote political stability in Nepal. However, these proposals have not been met with support from the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two biggest political forces in the country. It would be interesting to see how the proposed grand communist merger functions and how this issue gets positioned. New power held by the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and its positioning and practice would be interesting in matters related to amendments to the constitution. Also, the activity of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) would be interesting as the house progress and agenda progressed. Nepal has consistently seen and witnessed significant political debate over the proposal to shift to the presidential system of government, especially during elections. The current system, which includes a parliament and a prime minister, has faced criticism for its lack of stability and efficiency, leading some to argue that the presidential system would be a more effective solution. However, others argue that such a change would have significant consequences and may not address the root causes of Nepal’s political challenges. This has become a valid debate with the recent case of the dissolution of the five-party alliance led by the Nepali Congress and the recently reformed coalition among major communist forces. The question of political stability One of the main arguments made by proponents of the presidential system is that it would bring stability and efficiency to the government by allowing the president to make decisions without interference from other branches of the government. In the parliamentary system, the prime minister is dependent on the support of legislators and may be forced to compromise on key policy decisions in order to maintain their position. A president, on the other hand, would be able to make decisions independently and more easily implement their agenda. This would directly influence a nation’s progress or distress based on the quality of the leader and leadership proposition with bureaucracy. Additionally, some proponents argue that the presidential system would better reflect the will of the people, as the president is directly elected by the public rather than chosen by legislators. In the parliamentary system, the prime minister is not directly elected by the people and may not have a strong mandate to govern. A president, on the other hand, would have a direct mandate from the public and would be more accountable to voters. However, there are also strong arguments against the adoption of the presidential system in Nepal. Opponents argue that such a system could lead to an overly powerful executive branch and a weaker legislature, potentially undermining the checks and balances that are necessary for a healthy democracy. In the presidential system, the president has the ability to veto legislation and may be less accountable to the legislature than a prime minister in the parliamentary system. Another concern is that the presidential system could lead to a more divisive political climate as the president would be directly representing a particular political party or ideology. In the parliamentary system, the prime minister is typically chosen from the party that holds the most seats in the legislature and must work with other parties in order to govern effectively. A president, on the other hand, maybe more likely to prioritise the interests of their own party over the needs of the country as a whole. In order to adopt the presidential system in Nepal, the constitution would need to be amended. This process would involve the House of Representatives and would likely require a significant amount of time and political negotiation. There may also be challenges in obtaining the necessary support from other branches of government and the public. The major question is whether PM Dahal manages to bring communist forces together in the agenda of the presidential system and table the amendment proposal. Other impacts If Nepal were to shift to the presidential system, it could have significant consequences for the balance of power between branches of government, the distribution of resources, and the representation of different groups within society. The stability and effectiveness of the government could be impacted as could the broader political climate in the country. Ultimately, the decision of whether to adopt the presidential system in Nepal is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. It is important for the government and the people of Nepal to carefully consider the potential pros and cons of such a move before making a decision that could have significant consequences for the future of the country. In the context of Nepal’s political landscape, it is possible that a referendum could be held to gauge public support for a particular issue or proposal, such as the adoption of the presidential system of governance or the restoration of a monarchy or the continuation of the parliamentary system. But, we are yet to see how the newly formed government plans its honeymoon and settles down.",political

House of Representatives Speaker’s election on January 19,"Kathmandu, January 11 The House of Representatives is going to get its new speaker on January 19.

Prithvi Jayanti: Why does the National Unity Day divide Nepal every year?,"Today marks the 300th birth anniversary of the late King  Prithvi Narayan Shah , the country’s “founding father.” The nation celebrates the day as Prithvi Jayanti, which is also called National Unity Day. Restarting this year, the government has given a  public holiday on the occasion , which was halted following Nepal’s transformation into a republic in 2008.  But, Unity Day is dividing the nation again as many believe King Prithvi Narayan Shah was not the unifier but a conqueror who imposed an authoritarian monarchy over dozens of independent principalities.  It means regardless of the public holiday announcement as National Unity Day, Prithvi Jayanti has always been a matter of debate in Nepali politics, with people virtually divided over the contribution of the king born three centuries ago.  King Prithvi Narayan Shah: Unifier or murderer? While there are people who celebrate Prithvi Jayanti by worshipping Prithvi Narayan Shah’s statue, there are also political organisations like the  Mongol National Organisation  that mark the day by  calling for a boycott  of the history created under his leadership. As reported, the pro-monarchy Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) pressed the new prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to announce a public holiday on the occasion as the party says the nation should respect Prithvi Narayan Shah’s contribution. “Undoubtedly, he has established the identity of our country,” says Sharad Raj Pathak, an RPP general secretary, “But lately some deviated leftists are seen against Prithvi Narayan Shah and Prithvi Jayanti. They want to create instability and jeopardise existing harmony in the country.”  Nonetheless, Ang Kaji Sherpa, an indigenous community activist, says King Prithvi Narayan Shah was a murderer. “In the name of unification, Shah killed thousands of innocent lives.” But, Pathak says the voice of people like Sherpa should be ignored as their hatred does not carry any weight. “There are many people who, with their little knowledge, are following the leftists who deviate from their principles. But, it is our responsibility to make those people aware of the fact.”  Activist Sherpa contradicts Pathak as he says that King Prithvi Narayan Shah does not deserve to get such respect because he just unified the land but not the languages, cultures and religions that people had. He says, “Just because he unified land, he can not be considered the symbol of national unity.”    Sherpa believes his unification gave priority to a single language, culture and religion and posed indifference to minority groups. Hence, such a kind of unification is against the spirit of a country like Nepal having people from diverse religions and cultures.   Holiday or no holiday? People say Nepali politicians and their leaders tend to politicise every sector to meet their vested interests, and Sherpa says this is true in the recent decision to observe a public holiday on the occasion of Prithvi Jayanti also.  The holiday has been announced for the sake of securing the vote of confidence from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, according to him. The RPP had proposed the Prithvi Jayanti holiday as a precondition for its support to the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. Therefore, the government decided on the holiday on the eve of Dahal’s vote of confidence  held on Tuesday afternoon .  Speaking in the House meeting before extending his support to Dahal during the vote of confidence yesterday, RPP chairman Rajendra Lingden talked about Prithvi Jayanti although it was not necessary. He even managed to invite other parties to a tea party that his party is hosting on the occasion. But, Pathak says there is no vested interest as it was meant to honour the glory of King Prithvi Narayan Shah and the history he created. He demands the holiday continue in the next years also.  But, Sherpa doubts if the decision would continue once the RPP gets weaker. “If the RPP hadn’t won considerable seats in the House now, there would not have been any holiday today,” he says.",political
268 vs 2: Pushpa Kamal Dahal wins vote of confidence,"Kathmandu, January 10 After the main opposition, Nepali Congress  submitted itself to  t he ruling alliance , Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal won a vote of confidence of the House almost unopposed. Of the 270 lawmakers of the 275-member House who were present during the vote today, 268 voted for the premiership of the CPN-Maoist Centre chairman. Prem Suwal of the National Workers and Peasants Party and  Chitra Bahadur KC  of Rastriya Janamorcha opposed the motion of confidence vote. It means the  House of Representatives  does not have any opposition party for now as the two parties opposing Dahal have not got the recognition of a national party as per the parliamentary laws. Constitutional experts say the Nepali Congress now cannot claim itself as the opposition party although its president Sher Bahadur Deuba told the House that it would be in the opposition despite extending the vote of confidence to Dahal. Deuba’s membership of the Constitutional Council as the main opposition leader has come under serious question. It is assumed that  Deuba supported Dahal hoping for a favour  from the Maoist side for the  presidential election to be held  after a few weeks. Analysts say Deuba also hopes he could bring back Dahal from CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli’s side and revive the erstwhile coalition that contested the 2022 November elections together.",political

No main opposition!: Nepali Congress gives PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal a confidence vote,"Kathmandu, January 10 Surprising the political observers, the biggest party in the House of Representatives, the Nepali Congress, has given Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal a vote of confidence.  Although the party president Sher Bahadur Deuba told the House of Representatives that was holding the vote on Tuesday that it would not participate in the government and stay in opposition, parliamentary experts say giving the trust vote to the prime minister means the party joins the ruling side.

Prithvi Jayanti holiday is back after 15 years,"Kathmandu, January 10 Owing to pressure from the pro-monarchy Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the government has declared a public holiday for Wednesday (January 11) on the occasion of Prithvi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of the country’s founding father  King Prithvi Nayarayn Shah . Before the  abolition of the monarchy  in 2008, the day would be celebrated as National Unity Day by observing a nationwide holiday.

How Nepal’s new Pokhara airport might fall prey to India-China tussle,"Buddha Air  wants to commence its  Varanasi  flights from the newly inaugurated  Pokhara Regional International Airport . The airline company, on November 14, 2022, stated its intentions to start three flights a week from Pokhara to Varanasi and said it also wanted to start flights from Pokhara to Delhi and Dehradun in the future.  Their plan, however, took a massive hit when a Buddha Air plane to fly a chartered aircraft to Varanasi from the new Pokhara airport on January 1 did not receive permission to fly to India. Was this an intentional ploy from India or just a technical issue? The answer is anyone’s guess. Officials from the  Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal  say they will get an answer if Budhha Air manages to get permission from India to fly regularly to Varanasi from Pokhara in the future. “We can’t assume things just yet. We need to wait and see what happens because I don’t see any reason for India not to allow Buddha Air to fly to Varanasi from Pokhara as they have been doing so regularly from Kathmandu,” says a CAAN official. But, no one knows if India looks at the Pokhara airport only from a technical point of view or from a strategic and tactical point of view. The answer will be given within some time. However, the officials of the  Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation  are doubtful if the issue of flying to Indian cities from the Pokhara airport will be resolved through a simple and regular process. The ministry officials suspect India might purposely try to derail the project and prevent the Pokhara airport from becoming commercially successful. Why? Because Pokhara Airport was built with the help of loans provided by China,  which also claims  it is a part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative. Everybody knows India’s relationship with China has not been the best recently.  The rough runway  For the Pokhara airport to be successful, Nepal has to target Indian and Chinese tourists and establish direct flights to major cities of the two countries. The airport has been built with an expensive loan from China, so it is imperative that Nepal target the two countries if it wants the airport to be a commercial success. But, becoming a commercial success is a distant dream as the airport needs to make around Rs 2.5 billion just to pay the interest on the loans. It is highly likely China will fly aircraft to Pokhara, but if India will is a greater question that needs to be answered. People are sceptical because India has not allowed  Himalaya Airlines , an airline company owned by the  Yeti Group  and Chinese investors, to fly to India. Another reason why experts are unsure if India will fly its aircraft to the Pokhara airport is a lack of an easy, accessible and convenient route. Experts believe the Pokhara airport will suffer the same fate as Bhairahawa’s Gautam Buddha International Airport as foreign airline companies have been refusing to fly there mentioning the difficult air route. The Government of India has not agreed to allow aircraft to enter Nepal through Bhairahwa, Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar routes. This has caused a massive blow to both Bhairahawa and Pokhara airports. Many argue the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation and the government authorities have not put much effort into it. Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, a joint secretary of the ministry, says talks are ongoing about necessary initiatives and coordination is being taken with the Indian government regarding new air routes and entry points. “We’ve done what we needed to do. We are hopeful the Indian government will be open to allowing aircraft to enter Nepal from the west,” says Lamichhane. Currently, India allows aircraft to exit Nepal through Mahendranagar, Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Janakpur. But, India only allows one air route to enter Nepal: Simara. Nepal is lobbying to ensure India allows both entry and exit through the cities mentioned above. The talk has been going on for years, but India is yet to come to agree to the terms. This has caused major issues as  no international airline is flying to Gautam Buddha International Airport  resulting in a major loss for the government. The head of Gautam Buddha International Airport, Govinda Dahal, says that routes with air entry points from western Nepal are necessary and added international airline companies would be attracted to fly to this airport if Nepal gets permission. Vested interests? According to Lamichhane from the ministry, 60-70 per cent of the international flights in Nepal want to use the western route to enter Nepal. But, as India has not given permission, all of them enter Nepal via Simara in southern Nepal. The planes coming from Bhutan enter Nepal via Jhapa in the east and the planes coming from Lhasa enter Nepal via the Nunim Point (Bravo 345). According to CAAN, the western route (Gulf 589) is used by airlines coming from Gulf countries, Turkey and New Delhi in India. The east route (Romeo 581) is used for flights coming from Kolkata in India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, etc.  But, since India has not given permission to fly into Nepal from either of the routes, aircraft coming to Nepal have to come via Simara, which is a hassle for many. If India gives permission to enter Nepal via the western route, nearly 70 per cent of flights will not have to enter Nepal via Simara. India is reluctant to do this as it has been charging navigation fees from aircraft for using its air space for a longer duration.  If India does open the western and eastern air routes, Nepal would also be able to charge navigation fees and earn a good amount. This would also decrease the cost for international airlines, which would mean cheaper tickets.  According to experts, the longer the flight, the higher the air safety risk. India knows this, yet it is hesitating to give permission to open the two routes. Knots of negotiations Despite being aware that the air route has disrupted the operation of the Bhairahawa and Pokhara airports, the government of Nepal has not taken a high-level diplomatic initiative. Since the idea of the two airports surfaced, it was clear India would not give Nepal the air routes it needed. But, Nepal has been arguing that it is the country’s right to get the air route. A meeting was held in Kolkata to discuss this in 2016, but it bore no fruit. The officials from both sides were going to meet in October 2017, but the Nepali team could not go to India due to the risk of violating the election code of conduct. Then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, during his visit to India, met his counterpart Narendra Modi and spoke about this issue. Soon after that, CAAN and the  Airports Authority of India  met and discussed that a detailed technical study could be carried out regarding making the Kathmandu-Biratnagar and Kathmandu-Janakpur routes two-way for international flights and giving an entry route from Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar in the west for international flights. Accordingly, when the Nepali team reached Delhi to finalise the flight safety assessment, the Airport Authority of India suddenly withdrew from the agreement. According to Nepali officials, Indian counterparts have been citing the army’s reluctance as it has an army base on the routes Nepal wants permission for. But, these answers are a reason Nepali officials are not positive about getting the air routes opened. India has also blocked permission to use the ILS, a system that allows flights to land even in low visibility installed by Nepal at Bhairahawa airport. Former secretary and aviation official Yagya Prasad Gautam says that India should show goodwill and give an entry point from western Nepal. “Nepal needs to come up with a plan to solve this issue,” says Gautam. Many argue that India, which has not made things easy to operate the Bhairahawa airport, will definitely change its mind and smoothen things for the Pokhara airport as the latter has been stated as a BRI initiative.  It is clear that India has not treated China-related projects well in the past. Over the past few years, India has  vocally stated it w ould  not buy electricity generated from Chinese projects . China’s interest Meanwhile, China’s claim that the Pokhara airport is a BRI initiative is not entirely true.  The  One Belt-One Road (OBOR)  launched by China in 2013 was later called the  BRI project. China has called BRI  a project to help in the development and prosperity of neighbouring and friendly countries. However, due to cold relations with China, India has not joined the BRI project yet.  Nepal became a part of the BRI in 2017 with an agreement signed by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. But, the foundation of the Pokhara airport was laid in 2016, a year before Nepal joined the BRI. As of now, there has not been any project that has been constructed under the BRI initiative as Nepal has not officially signed any agreement that falls under it. To put it bluntly, Nepal is not aware of  what projects are BRI and what are not .  However, the officials of the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu have repeatedly described the Pokhara airport as a project within the BRI. On the same day as the airport was inaugurated, the charge d’affaires at Kathmandu’s Chinese embassy, Wang Xin formally recalled the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Nepal and also recalled the announcement of the creation of an aerial network to connect the Himalayas to the world.  He said that a profitable project had been launched to turn the BRI’s vision into reality and tried to interpret the Pokhara airport as a link to it. On April 21, 2022, then-Chinese Ambassador Hou Yanqi also explained in a press conference that the project advanced by the Chinese side in Nepal was under the BRI project. However, experts in foreign affairs feel China is overstepping. Former Foreign Minister and UML leader Pradeep Gyawali says China is wrong to claim the Pokhara airport to be a BRI project. “We signed the BRI in 2017. When President Bidya Devi Bhandari went to the BRI conference in 2019, we defined the BRI as a Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which includes railways, highways, optical fibre, and ports,” Gyawali says, adding he does not understand why the charge d’affaires could claim the Pokhara airport as a BRI project. He says the airport was not on the list of nine projects selected by Nepal to fall under the BRI.  “Maybe it’s what power countries do. The US also wants to list all its projects in Nepal under the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS). I think the US has a major role in the  MCC project being disputed  in Nepal,” he says. Experts in foreign affairs say that it is the government’s responsibility to clarify that such projects made with foreign aid based on the needs of Nepal do not jeopardise the interests of other countries. Former Nepali ambassador to China, Tanka Karki, says that it is normal to request foreign countries to help fulfil national needs. “But, the countries cannot interfere in the country’s national interest,” says Karki. “We should stop taking decisions thinking we’ll anger India or China when taking help either of them. That’s not how diplomacy works.” Former ambassador Karki says the country should be able to reject assertions such as the Pokhara airport being a part of the BRI while remaining committed to its declared policy.  “We should take maximum benefits from our neighbours, and we should promise not to use the land to the detriment of each other,” he says. “We should also seek cooperation from other countries by maintaining friendly relations, believing that such cooperation won’t be used to the detriment of neighbouring countries.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Federal system in Nepal faces big challenges amid growing disenchantment,"Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah  did not vote for members of the Provincial Assembly in the  elections held on November 20, 2022 . As he walked out of the polling station after casting votes for a member of the House of Representatives, the security guards reminded him that he still had to vote for provincial assembly members. Mayor Shah just ignored the call and left the polling booth. This is only one example of how people in general, even public officials, are dissatisfied with the idea of the provincial government, if not the entire federal system in Nepal.  The country has been experimenting with the federal system of governance for five years. However, anytime the country’s economic and other difficulties are discussed, everyone,  including the media , tends to blame the present federal system, which has three tiers of government: federal, provincial and local. They argue, in particular, that Nepal’s current provincial structures should be dismantled if the country’s economy and political system are to be saved. In this explainer,  examines key challenges facing the federal system in Nepal, besides the rationale for the introduction of the system. We also explain the causes for growing disenchantment with provincial governments, and the accomplishments made thus far by the federal system.  Evolution of the federal system in Nepal Nepal practised a unitary form of governance since its unification, which officially began in 1743. Many saw federalism as the solution to reducing regional inequality and development disparities as a result of growing concerns that the unitary system failed to achieve the development aspirations of people. It was also perceived as exclusionary in nature. After the Interim Constitution on May 28, 2008, turned Nepal into a republic, overthrowing the 240-year-old Shah monarchy, the country adopted the federal system of governance. Following the Madheski people’s revolt in 2007,  the fifth amendment to the constitution  officially acknowledged the country as the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.  The federal system in Nepal was envisioned as a crucial aspect of the country’s new governing system. The advent of federalism was inspired by the need to overcome  three major challenges  that the country had been facing for millennia. The primary goal was to devolve political and economic authority away from Kathmandu’s centralised administration. The second key objective was to ensure a balanced development across the country’s geographical regions. Third, federalism was intended to increase opportunities for and participation of ordinary people at all levels, with a goal to end different forms of discrimination in Nepal. In the years that followed, major political parties engaged in agonising negotiations to determine the number of provinces and municipal levels. Finally, they settled on seven provinces, 77 districts, and 753 local units to establish the federal system in Nepal. Each of the seven provinces has its own government led by the chief minister, with the federal government at the centre. All 753 local bodies have their own governments that exercise executive powers and oversee the day-to-day affairs of their people. Challenges facing the federal system in Nepal The move to transition from a unitary to a federal system in Nepal was not without difficulty. As the unitary system of governance was turned into the federal system, Nepal faced a number of obstacles in the early years of federalism. Nepal will face new challenges if it does not strengthen governance and address lingering issues. For example, the division of power, particularly between the federal and provincial administrations, has been a thorny issue. According to research conducted by  External Democracy Promotion,  people are divided about the existing power distribution, and there is often conflict between different levels of government. The federal government retains important  executive powers , but provincial and municipal governments are yet to build sufficient institutional capacity to execute all of the functions including service delivery delegated to them. Schedule 9 of Nepal’s constitution lists the powers that the federal, provincial, and local governments have. The functions allocated to the three-tier governments, however,  overlap . For example, confusion exists under the new constitution over the delineation of jurisdiction between federal provinces and municipal entities, owing to the rights to collect taxes granted to all tiers of government. Furthermore, all three levels of government share powers such as the administration of drinking water, the recording of personal events such as birth, death and marriage, as well as the maintenance of ancient monuments and archaeological sites.  The implementation of the federal system in Nepal has already proven expensive due to the need for additional governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the country’s subnational units are significantly reliant on the federal government for budgetary resources. In most situations, they are unable to create considerable quantities of revenue on their own. According to a 2020 study, provincial governments receive 15% of the entire national government budget. Corruption has also been reported at all levels of the government, and many people are questioning the use of funds to establish federalism. Then, there are administrative challenges. To effectively implement the federal system in Nepal, provincial and municipal governments require a well-trained and capable civil service workforce. However, many are currently understaffed since officials prefer to serve at the federal system rather than the provincial level. A four-month study of federalism commissioned by the National Assembly and led by its member Dr Khim Lal Devkota recommended several measures to overcome the challenges. In its  final report , the study identified a number of problems such as a lack of clarity in jurisdiction among federal, provincial and local governments; failure of provincial and local governments to ensure the rights of women, and failure to implement the recommendations of constitutional bodies. The report highlighted issues such as decentralisation of powers, implementation of administrative federalism, building institutional structures, ensuring inter-provincial and inter-local government cooperation and coordination and fiscal federalism to effectively implement the federal system in Nepal.  Resentment against provincial governments It has been a mixed bag for Nepal in its first five years of federalism. While most people view the federal system in Nepal positively, many others consider it to be a cause of financial concern. People have little reservations about local governments or the federal government. In recent years, however,  public dissatisfaction  with provincial governments has increased. The cost of the government and legislature–a total of 550 province assembly members and government officials–is a key factor for dissatisfaction.   The number of provincial assembly members is approximately double that of the federal parliament, which has 334 members altogether, including 59 National Assembly members. The advantages, benefits, and salaries enjoyed by provincial members are nearly identical to those enjoyed by federal legislators. The chief minister in each province serves as the head of the government. The provinces have appointed 230 ministers and 14 chief ministers in the last five years. In recent years, a large majority of people, including former provincial ministers, have begun to question whether parallel government structures are necessary at such a high cost to the state. Growing cases of corruption and malpractice in provincial administrations are also a matter of concern regarding the federal system in Nepal. Provincial governments were supposed to provide good governance and effective service delivery to people, decentralising services previously provided by the federal government. Provincial governments, however, have found themselves embroiled in larger corruption scandals. For example, the Madhesh provincial government  was accused of embezzling  Rs 100 million while purchasing bicycles for the Beti Padhau: Beti Bachau scheme, which aims to  promote girls’ education . A culture of corruption and financial mismanagement has been entrenched in the federal system in Nepal through the use of the Constituency Development Fund, mirroring practices at the federal level. A study conducted by Nepal Check earlier  showed  provincial assembly members have already spent millions of rupees from the funds, much of which cannot be accounted for. The constant leadership changes and inter-party squabbles in the provinces have also contributed to various forms of misconduct. These state structures have faced criticism for their inefficiency and for making unrealistic promises to the public, while also adding an unnecessary financial burden on the people.  Provincial govts’ struggle Provincial assemblies laid the foundation of the provincial governments in the past five years. However, the federal government has not provided adequate support for these efforts. Except for Province 1, all provinces have named their provinces and begun employing civil servants through the Provincial Public Service Commission. While provincial assemblies have passed over 437 laws, they have been unable to establish provincial police units, owing to  non-cooperation from the federal government . Despite their efforts to confront the federal government for the lack of cooperation and exercise their own authority, provincial administrations have largely failed to meet the people’s expectations. With the exception of the chief ministers of Sudurpaschim and Madhesh provinces, none of the other chief ministers was able to finish their five-year tenure. As a result, 230 of the 550 provincial assembly members were appointed as ministers, with 14 of them becoming chief ministers. Despite these obstacles, the Madhesh province has made strides toward institutionalizing the federal system in Nepal by establishing three universities and developing draft legislation for Provincial Civil Service Act and the Provincial Police Act. However, it has been unable to recruit police personnel on its own because the federal government has not yet approved the draft of the Province Police Act. Despite federal government opposition, former Gandaki Chief Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung launched efforts to build an alliance with other chief ministers to enhance their collective voice and lobby for more rights. He held a  conference in Pokhara  where chief ministers discussed how to deal with the federal government’s lack of cooperation. The conference concluded that they were unable to fulfil people’s expectations as the federal government did not allow them to exercise autonomy. They maintained that the failure to provide the provincial government with adequate rights and resources had made the provincial government weak, leaving even ordinary people to question the rationale behind the federal system in Nepal. Provincial assembly members argue strengthening the provincial government is vital for the country’s federalism to be institutionalised. Shalik Ram Jammarkattel, a former economic affairs and planning minister of Bagmati, says questioning the provincial government’s role is unconstitutional because it is necessary for the federal system in Nepal to work. He says the provincial government is a link between the federal and local governments and should be reinforced as a result. Jammarkattel says without a provincial administration, neither federalism nor the current constitution would exist. Some success stories Nonetheless, the federal system in Nepal has aided  service delivery  in the country, particularly in education and healthcare. The transfer of authorities and duties from the central government to municipal and provincial governments enables subnational actors to make decisions that better reflect the interests of local populations. Provincial and local governments have created innovative programmes to serve people– something the federal government has failed to do. In some ways, the federal system in Nepal has allowed these subnational groups to compete with or outperform the federal government, creating a benchmark by which they can measure their own success.  Local governments  played an important role  in preventing the spread of Covid in Nepal. The local government took steps to establish quarantines, track those who arrived from overseas or beyond their jurisdictions, and distribute emergency supplies to vulnerable citizens. They also provided for the rescue of trapped migrant workers, students, and others in Kathmandu. Provincial administrations were unable to respond as efficiently as they should have due to a lack of clarity on their duties and responsibilities. They also faced a resource crunch. However, they were instrumental in establishing Covid-specialised hospitals and providing further help through municipalities. The provinces with major border crossings played a key role in supporting local and federal governments during the inflow of migrants from India following the outbreak of the pandemic.  Conclusion No system of governance is perfect. Nepal has experienced several governance systems including hereditary Rana rule, authoritarian monarchy, and constitutional monarchy. The most recent–the federal system–was implemented in the 2015 constitution but has yet to deliver the expected outcomes. Dr Khim Lal Devkota, an expert on the federal system in Nepal, says a lack of proper guardianship during the last five years was a major factor. He says political parties must enhance personnel management, law drafting, institutional construction, capacity training for politicians and bureaucrats at the province and local levels, and fiscal transfers to promote coordination among the three levels of government. For the federal system in Nepal to succeed, the federal government must provide guardianship to empower subnational governments. “The subnational levels also need to pay sincere attention to the implementation of federalism. There is no need to panic or feel frustrated in the implementation of the federal system in Nepal even as there are some ups and downs,” Devkota says. “Federalism will start delivering tangible results if political parties become honest enough to implement it.” first appeared on Nepal Check",political

"Unified Socialist, betrayed by the Maoists, launches merger talks with the JSPN","Kathmandu, January 3 Before the general elections in 2022 November, there were  speculations  that the CPN-Unified Socialist would merge with the CPN-Maoist Centre. They had also agreed to have  a joint manifesto  for the polls, which could not materialise. But, now, it seems the two parties are getting farther away with the  Maoist Centre joining hands with the CPN-UML , against whom the Unified Socialist revolted to form the party. Perhaps, the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led CPN-Unified Socialist is feeling betrayed by the Maoists. In this situation, the Unified Socialist has launched merger talks with the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSPN).  Speaking with the press on Monday, the Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada hinted that the party was in conversations with the JSPN in the renewed unification bid.  On the other hand, the JSPN is also discussing the proposal and possibility, informs the party’s political committee member Manikar Karki. Both parties are not satisfied with their performance in the 2022 November elections.

Supporting CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal  Dahal for the prime ministerial position , the UML has made the ruling alliance agree that it will take over the president’s and the speaker’s roles. Because the alliance is in majority in the House, the UML’s candidate is certain to win.  In this context, both Bishwakarma and Gurung have expressed their desire to be the speaker and communicated it with the party chairman KP Sharma Oli. Apparently, whoever gets Oli’s nod can become the ruling alliance’s official candidate. Former speaker and a confidant of Oli, Subas Chandra Nembang, is also lobbying for Bishwakarma.

Instead, he wants to be the president of the country. It is not clear which senior leaders are supporting Gurung.

"Good, bad and ugly of Sher Bahadur Deuba: How do his decisions impact Nepal’s democracy?","A little while ago, I had an opportunity to meet Bharat Prasad Upreti, the founder president of the Nepali Congress’ Dhading chapter. Upreti, who is in his nineties, started his political journey in the district by joining the Congress party in 1949. He actively participated in all political revolutions and movements since 1950. Upreti, who survived many painful experiences during both the Rana and Panchayat periods, had a long association with great leaders such as  BP Koirala , Subarna Shamsher, and Ganesh Man Singh. Upreti claims Koirala used to come to his house in Baneshwar for tea. Some mornings, he would visit Koirala’s house in Chabahil to reciprocate. Obviously, they would talk about politics most of the time. Talking about the Congress leaders of that time, Upreti recently mentioned  Sher Bahadur Deuba . “At that time, courage was not enough to raise the flag of democracy against the Panchayat regime,” he said, “But, I have seen Sher Bahadur had the guts to face any difficulty (to speak against the regime).” The revolutionary version of Deuba  In the words of Upreti: A boy from the far west The new version of Deuba During those years, the leaders used to compete with each other in terms of  “revolutionariness” at the front of the struggle. Consequently, the leaders including Sher Bahadur Deuba proved themselves adept at changing the political system.  They also succeeded in making Nepal a republic and writing an  inclusive constitution . But, they could not make the daily life of the common people easy. If you make a list of the problems Nepal is facing, it gets as long as all the roads in the country join together. It may be relevant to recall a context from the Soviet era here. Vladimir Lenin’s followers went to a village to convince people of the revolution, but the peasants were not ready to listen to them. And Lenin, who was also there commanding his team, understood the needs of the farmers and distributed tractors. It resulted in peasants chanting ‘Long live Lenin!’. Citizens do not understand the importance of democracy until it starts to serve their daily life system. As the old generation of Nepali politics has lost the ability to deliver services to the citizens, democracy has become insignificant to them. Sher Bahadur Deuba’s generation has already got a lot of opportunities at present just because they contributed to the nation in history. Becoming the prime minister five times is an opportunity beyond the imagination for the leaders of most democratic countries of the world. However, in the case of Deuba, this is taken for granted. He was active in leading the change of the political system, but he misused the opportunities he had by setting bad precedents one after another. Deuba continued to strive to make parliamentary politics a ‘pig cage’ as Lenin said. Addicted to power, he has become a tendency from an individual, a tendency to compromise anything for it. This tendency erased his glorious history. He always ignored the opportunity to restore the history of glory by changing the ‘course’ of power-oriented politics. Recently, it was seen that he chose the path of decadence. Many leaders who maintained their political integrity during the period of extreme repression of rulers have ended themselves up in the lust for power. This has become a trend in Nepali politics, with examples galore.  Sher Bahadur Deuba had an opportunity to restore his ‘brave’ image when he was  contesting the parliamentary party election  with the party’s “youth” leader Gagan Thapa. However, he wasted this opportunity by forgetting that he once fought against Girija Prasad Koirala. Earlier, Girija Prasad Koirala used to be introduced as the leader who got his several effigies burnt. The leadership skills he exhibited at a particular moment in history restored him to politics. The civil war came to an end due to his wisdom. It was possible because of his ability to turn a political crisis into an opportunity. At that time, no one else could make that decision except him. But today, Deuba did not bother to follow that path. The impact Even now, Nepali politics is at risk. Leaders are saying that the achievement of change is in crisis. There are clear signs that the country is following the path of Sri Lanka economically and the Philippines politically. It was not long ago that an economic crisis erupted in Sri Lanka and the acting president had to flee the country overnight. In the Philippines, the son of the infamous dictator Ferdinand Marcos has returned to power. Marcos Jr has become the president out of the languor of democratic forces and (ab)use of the young generation addicted to social media who are unknown of the history of the recent past. The same background is being prepared in our country. The population of the generation that fought against the Panchayat and Rana regimes is getting weaker. The generation born after the people’s war of the CPN-Maoist and the 2006 people’s movement is growing up. They do not know the Panchayat and royal rules. Like in the Philippines, the new generation of Nepal, who is in the Internet age, is not even interested in history. It seems that the increase in procrastination of the democratic forces is facilitating the growth of regressive forces in Nepal.   In this situation, Sher Bahadur Deuba’s wise decision could have been of far-ranging importance. This decision would not have been as effective if it had been made by someone else. But, he stubbornly missed that opportunity. The recent general elections have also given a message that frustration is growing among the citizens. If the central politics of the country continues to deviate in the same way, there is a risk that this dissatisfaction will turn into mass frustration. The leaders of the older generation seem to be oblivious to the flames of growing dissatisfaction within Nepali society. Unlearned Deuba  Sher Bahadur Deuba is not an empty-headed leader. He made the party the first in the recently concluded elections. However, in politics, it is not enough to pass one exam; they have to keep taking and passing several tests. Deuba could not make decisions according to the changed political equation and polarisation. Even within the party, he could learn from Shekhar Koirala’s latest and sensible decision to withdraw from the bid to become the leader of the parliamentary party. That decision has made Koirala not weak, but more reliable and potent. The power gained by winning trust in politics is many times more powerful and lasting than the power gained by authority. Gagan Thapa patiently walked a long but sustainable democratic path and convinced Shekhar Koirala to support him. Koirala became ready to trust the new generation for political transformation.  Bishwa Prakash Sharma continued to support Thapa . Another young leader, Pradip Paudel, also came to support him, understanding that the division of the new generation would help the old one. In this way, a new phase of polarisation took place within the Nepali Congress. But, Sher Bahadur Deuba followed  his astrologer’s advice  and the instigation of his kitchen cabinet. He did not pay attention to the changing politics inside and outside the party. Although he understood the situation, he did not consider what steps could have been wise. As a result, he lost what he had in his desperate bid to gain more. Along with himself, he made the Congress party a ‘losing gambler’ too suddenly. There was a competition within the Congress party for the leader of the parliamentary party. This is natural in a democratic party, but a democratic competition does not always give the best results. Deuba was elected the leader and showed partisanship towards the rival group.  If Sher Bahadur Deuba had shown wisdom to pave the way for the young generation by restraining his ambition to become the leader of the parliamentary party for the sixth time, the political landscape of the country and his height would have been different. But, Deuba did not even care about the history of the Nepali Congress that Ganesh Man Singh became an all-respected leader (sarbamanya neta) even by rejecting the position of prime minister. Instead, he pushed himself to the path of a depressing political exit.   This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Insiders, however, say Sah does not want to lead the party in the long run, but he wants to merge it with the Maoist Centre as soon as possible. Sah was a key leader of the Maoist party representing the Madhesh region before he stayed in the CPN-UML when the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP)  was split . But, as the UML has already taken  action against him  and he has also betrayed the party leadership, his return to the UML is highly unlikely. It means he might want to go back to the Maoist Centre. But, why did he announce a new party then? “When you join us representing a party, you’ll have more bargaining powers,” a leader of the Maoist party says. On the day of the party announcement, Prabhu Sah also commissioned a three-member committee to hold talks with like-minded parties for the purposes of cooperation and merger on the day of the party announcement. It also clearly signifies he wants to merge this party with a bigger one as soon as it gets recognised. “We may be unified with some progressive forces in the future,” Sah says, The Maoists are also a progressive force.”",political

2022 review: 12 notable happenings in Nepali politics in the past 12 months,"Nepali politics is ruthless. A friend today is a foe tomorrow as  you have seen over the past week . Even if Nepali politics cannot guarantee stability, what it does guarantee is absolute drama. And, a lot of drama took place this year. It was the year of the local, provincial and federal elections. The elections saw the fall of old heads as new and young candidates emerged. Alternative parties emerged as did independent candidates. At the end of the year, an unusual alliance got formed as Nepal saw  Pushpa Kamal Dahal become prime minister  for the third time. So what happened over the past year – let’s take a look. 1. CJ Rana impeachment saga Lawmakers of the then-ruling alliance  filed an impeachment motion  against Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana on   13 this year. From then till his  recent retirement , CJ Rana remained at the centre of controversy in Nepali politics with him being  accused of asking for his representation  in the new cabinet in exchange for the  constitutional bench reinstating the parliament . He was not impeached, but as his term came to an end in  , he left office without having stepped foot in the supreme court since February 2022.  2. MCC ratification Despite  various protests , Nepal’s parliament  ratified the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) grant  on  27. Nepal  signed the deal with the United States government  on September 14, 2017, to receive a USD 500 million grant for road and electricity infrastructure projects. Despite the public being against it, the ruling alliance led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba  decided to pass the deal . It, however, decided to add an interpretative declaration to address various concerns raised in Nepal about the impact of the deal. Following the ratification, voices against the deal have been virtually silenced in Nepali politics.  3. Rise of Balens The local elections in Nepal held in   saw  the rise of independent candidates , giving a new message in Nepali politics. People like  Balen Shah ,  Harka Sampang  and  Gopal Hamal  won their elections quite easily. Their win also gave the people a lot of hope for change. The local elections saw many  young people go out and vote , something that did not happen in the provincial and federal elections. 4. The keys to the finance ministry In  , Finance Minister  Janardan Sharma resigned  after the national daily newspaper  Annapurna Post published  news that he changed tax rates in the budget plan for the next fiscal year under some industrialists’ pressure. As the news reported that the industrialists entered the ministry office on the eve of the budget announcement to tamper with the document, there was a call to investigate the CCTV footage. But, the footage was missing. Following his resignation, a House committee was formed to investigate the case. The committee  did not find any evidence , after which  Sharma was reinstated as the finance minister , setting a bad precedent in Nepali politics. 5. Consistent citizenship bill dispute In  , President Bidya Devi Bhandari  returned the citizenship bill  to the parliament, suggesting a reconsideration, bringing herself into a conflict with the executive, which is quite rare in Nepali politics.  Both houses, however, approved the bill  as it was and sent it to the president. Endorsing the bill to amend the Citizenship Act through both houses of the federal parliament, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota  sent the bill to the head of the state  seeking its final assent on September 5.  As per the constitution, the head of the state was required to approve the citizenship bill sent to her for the second time within 15 days of her office receiving it. However,  she did not do so by September 20 . Later, the President’s Office said President Bidya Devi Bhandari refused to enact the controversial citizenship bill in September as the bill was against the nation, and as the head of the state, she had a  veto to protect the national interests . It seems the dispute will resurface in the new government’s term also as citizenship has been a bone of contention in Nepali politics for the last several years. 6. Death of Pradip Giri Pradip Giri, a lawmaker of the Nepali Congress party,  died aged 75  on   21. Giri was a socialist thinker and philosopher. His views were respected by most of his peers and even his opponents. He was a member of the Nepali Congress, but he was so well-versed in communism that he was frequently invited to train communists in Nepal. His funeral was attended by all the senior leaders of the country. His visionary thinking will be missed in Nepali politics. 7. Frail federalism Prior to the elections in  , many leaders openly talked about the poor implementation of the federal governance system in Nepal. Rabi Lamichhane-led party decided  not to contest the provincial elections  while other parties like Rastriya Prajatantra Party and Rastra Janamorcha Party have been calling for it to be scarped entirely. Even the parties that are pro-federalism are not happy with the way provincial governments are functioning in Nepali politics. 8. Old heads told no Elections are tough on senior party leaders as tough choices have to be made on who gets a ticket to contest the   elections. This year, Nepal saw how chiefs of both the Nepali Congress and the UML became ruthless as they did not give tickets to senior leaders for speaking against the leadership. Outspoken leader Bhim Rawal was told he would not be given a ticket by the UML along with Ghanshyam Bhusal. Nepali Congress also refused to give tickets to Minindra Rijal and economist Swarnim Wagle. With this,  calls for intra-party primaries  to select electoral candidates are growing louder in Nepali politics. 9. Time for an alternative As Shah, Sampang and Hamal won independently, many others announced to contest the provincial and federal elections scheduled for   on their own.  Sagar Dhakal  and  Ranju Darshana  announced their candidacy for the federal elections as the two went against the likes of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Ishwar Pokharel respectively. The local elections also gave birth to Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party, which  did an amazing job  in the federal elections as it won seven first-past-the-post and 13 proportional representation seats, winning multiple constituencies in Kathmandu valley itself. The rise of  CK Raut  and Ranjita Shrestha with their Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti Party did well in the elections as they have become kingmakers in Nepali politics. 10. The downfall of established Madhesi parties The established Madhesh-based parties have done a lot to stay relevant in Nepali politics, but this year saw their effort go in vain as the country’s  mainstream parties took back power  in Madhesh in the   elections. Only Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal and Janamat Party became national parties while the region’s prominent leaders such as Upendra Yadav, Hridayesh Tripathi and Rajendra Mahato all lost. Loktantrik Samajbadi Party did win six seats, but it failed to become a national party. 11. Time for ‘fierceness’ After Sher Bahadur  Deuba defeated Gagan Thapa  to become the parliamentary party leader of the Nepali Congress, it was almost certain that he would be the prime minister. But, in a surprising turn of events, Pushpa Kamal  Dahal became the prime minister  of the country in the last week of   after Deuba failed to meet the demands put forward by Dahal in which the latter had stated he wanted to be PM before Deuba. In a more surprising turn of events in Nepali politics, Dahal joined hands with KP Sharma Oli, with whom he was not on good terms for the past two years. In Dahal’s appointment,  international media remembered his guerrilla army force  and interpreted his nom de guerre ‘ Prachanda ‘ as “fierce”. But, it is not clear how fierce Dahal can be in his third term.  12. Foreigners’ interest This year also, Nepal saw a lot of foreign leaders visiting Kathmandu, proving once again that Nepali politics matters for them also. High-ranking officials from both the US and China came to Nepal. Chinese foreign minister  Wang Yi came to Nepal  for three days in March.  Liu Jianchao , the head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party also came to Nepal along with Chinese Speaker  Li Zhanshu . US officials also visited Nepal a lot this year. US Assistant Secretary for Global Public Affairs  Elizabeth Kennedy Trudeau visited Nepal  along with  Donald Lu , the United States assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs. Along with that, a  four-member delegation of the US Congress  paid a three-day visit to Nepal. United States Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights and US Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues,  Uzra Zeya also came to Nepal  in 2022 along with the commanding general of the US Army Pacific,  General Charles Flynn .",political
Why does Lalitpur leadership continue discrimination against the wards outside the ring road?,"There are 29 wards in the  Lalitpur metropolitan city . Ideally, all these wards should have received equal priority from the city leadership. However, stakeholders in seven wards have complained the city government has been practising discrimination against them.  Biased budget allocation Wards 18, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the Lalitpur metropolitan city are located outside the Kathmandu-Lalitpur ring road. The city government has failed to address local developmental demands there. The poor road condition of places such as Ekantakuna, Nakkhu Dobato, and Bhaisipati shows the real condition of the area.  Every year, the majority of the budget in Lalitpur metropolitan city is allocated for the wards inside the ring road. For example, a plan to instal smart street lights, which is limited to the ring road and the areas inside it, has a budget of Rs 35 million.  Similarly, the budget for sewage and sanitation is also only allocated for the place inside the ring road and around the  core city of Patan . The city government has started to construct a 2.8-km sewage system from Lagankhel to Patan Durbar Square and Shankhamul.  As per the budget plan, the next focus would be settling the water overflow problem in Manga Hiti, Mahapal, and Patan Durbar Square areas during the monsoon.  There are plans to allocate money for covering telephone, electricity and internet wires underground inside the ring road. But, the recent budget plan does not mention anything about the beautification of areas outside the ring road.  Meanwhile, locals say the city government has not done anything substantial to preserve the ancient indigenous settlements of Bungamati, Khokana and Harisddhi.  There is a possibility of the shift of the business hubs from Kathmandu to Lalitpur, but the city government does not have any plan or policy to make it happen. Jhamsikhel, Mangalbazar and Jawalakhel of Lalitpur are developing in a way similar to Thamel, Ason and New Road of Kathmandu. They have a higher chance of becoming a business hub. Perhaps that is why the city government is focused more on these areas. Yet, the leadership appears slow in expediting its plans. Mayor Chiri Babu Maharjan, after being elected in 2017, had proposed a plan to make a cold store in the vegetable markets of Jawalakhel and Lagankhel, to establish a commercial building in Lagankhel, and to build a slaughterhouse in Sundharighat. But, none of these plans has been implemented yet.  Similarly, he also unveiled a plan to construct a new ring road connecting Pulchok, Mangalbazar, Hattiban, Harisiddhi, Thaiba, Santaneyshwor, Nagdaha, Bajrabarahi, Thecho, Sunakothi, Bungamati, Kokhana and Pulchok. But, it has not yet materialised.  Lalitpur metropolitan city, being a hub for arts and crafts, has the possibility to create an economic system around it. But, the culturally rich sites like Bungamati too are being neglected, say the locals.  Woes of wards outside the ring road According to Sagar Tuladhar, the ward chair of Lalitpur metropolitan city 22, the budget allocated for physical infrastructure will just cover the areas inside the ring road.   “We feel like we have been deprived of many other basic rights,” he says.  He adds that there are a lot of things to do in the education and health sectors in his ward, but the city government is only focused on other areas.  Likewise, Ganesh Kumar Maharjan, the chair of ward 29, says the city leadership has failed to meet its promise.   “Our ward has always been neglected, and it is not just now. We have been neglected even before Lalitpur became the metropolitan city,” says Maharjan. According to him, the increment of Rs 10 million in the budget has not made any notable changes. The development of physical infrastructure should take place even outside the ring road, but that is not taking place.  In Lalitpur-29, there is not even a government health post. The blacktopped road is not beyond one km. The city government also has not done anything for the promotion of the Harisiddhi temple. “We have knocked on the door of the metropolitan office several times, but we have always been unheeded.”  However, the spokesperson of the city government, Raju Maharjan, says that the local body has not done any kind of discrimination among the wards. He claims that the metropolitan office has given special priority to the wards outside the ring road for physical infrastructure development.  “The developmental plans include agricultural growth and soil erosion control. As they are not suitable for the wards inside the ring road, we dedicate such programmes to the outer wards,” he says.  It is true that some projects of physical infrastructure have been delayed, but the cause behind this is the dispute among the locals, Maharjan claims. The health post will be established in ward 29 within this year, he says, adding the city government also plans to distribute water from the  Melamchi water supply project  outside the ring road also.

Who is Nepal’s new PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’? 9 facts you should know,"In an interesting turn of events, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, most popularly known as Prachanda,  has become the new prime minister of Nepal .  This is the third time the chair of the CPN-Maoist Centre will lead the country, the first two being in 2008 and 2016. Leaving the coalition led by Nepali Congress due to disputes regarding who will become the prime minister first, Dahal, on Sunday, once again  joined forces with the KP Sharma Oli  even after a  bittersweet ending of the Nepal Commun ist Party. Dahal or Prachanda is not the most popular leader in the country, but despite his party only securing 32 seats in the House of Representatives, he has become the prime minister of the country which goes to show the power play he can be a part of the country’s developing (or frustrating) political scene. Let us take a look at some interesting facts about the Maoist leader and see what makes him stand out: 1. The instigator of the people’s war In a bid to make the country a fair and just place for the poor and working class, Prachanda announced a people’s war in a bid to abolish the monarchy. He formed a “people’s army” from the marginalised areas of the country and attacked seven police stations and army camps taking over major parts of western Nepal. The  war went on  for 10 years and over 17,000 people died, but his goal to end Nepal’s 237-year-old monarchy was a success as Nepal’s King Gyanendra Shah was overthrown and Nepal became a republic. 2. The guerrilla warrior who never took part in fighting Many believe Prachanda was the brains behind the entire war as they claim they never saw him pick up a gun. He was rarely seen in his combat dress or with a gun in hand. What he was good at was his orations. There are several videos on YouTube where  thousands of people have assembled to hear Dahal speak . His oration was such that people say they got goosebumps and were ready to die for his cause. 3. The first prime minister of the republic of Nepal After the ceasefire in 2006, Prachanda and his party became a household name. When they contested in the 2008 general elections in the country, they received the highest popular votes in the country as even people from Kathmandu voted for them. Following that, he became the first prime minister of the republic of Nepal even though his group was still considered a terrorist in the United States of America. 4. ‘President on the wall’ After the war, Prachanda wanted to end the Westminster parliamentary system and adopt a directly elected presidential system. He had been telling this to his comrades for years. Prior to the 2008 elections, his followers even put up posters making a case for him to become the president of federal Nepal. But that failed and  people called him bhitte rastrapati  (a President on the wall). 5. Irresistible fear of loss Prachanda has also never repeated a constituency while contesting the elections except once in 2013. In his first elections, he contested from Kathmandu and Rolpa; in 2013, he contested from Kathmandu and Sarlahi; in 2017, from Chitwan and in 2022, he decided to contest the elections from Gorkha. If this is a masterstroke or if it is a fear of losing is an answer only he can give. 6. Terrible first term His first term as the prime minister ended on a bittersweet note after he fired the Chief of Army Staff, Rookmangud Katawal, due to a dispute over the integration of former rebel fighters into the army. That caused major issues as the move was unconstitutional. Katawal was reinstated by President Ram Baran Yadav, after which the prime minister came  under moral pressure to resign . 7. Slap on his face In 2012, Padam Kunwar slapped Prachanda at a party event. Kunwar had said he slapped him because of what the Maoist party had become and how Dahal had drifted away from his beliefs and betrayed people like him. The  public considered Kunwar a hero . 8. Ultimate opportunist Prachanda has always been an ultimate opportunist as he has always ended up in a power position despite claiming to be the victim. His critics say he is self-centred and clever and will leave his closest aides behind if it benefits him. This can be seen by his recent actions in leaving the Nepali Congress-led coalition along with his past actions and the manner in which he abandoned Mohan Biadya, Netra Bikram Chand and Baburam Bhattarai. 9. Political player Many had claimed the Maoists were an irrelevant party as they only won 32 out of the 275 seats in the House of Representatives. It is the third-largest party behind the Nepali Congress and the UML. But leaving all that aside, Prachanda twisted politics in such a way that he will be serving his third term as the prime minister of the country.",political

How Jubeda Khatun leapfrogged from school to parliament in a span of 7 years,"Jubeda Khatun from Bardiya was going to school with her daughter seven years ago. However, she has a different routine now as she attends college these days.  In the next few weeks, she will have an added responsibility–attending parliament meetings each and every day–as she has recently been elected as a federal House of Representatives member. Nepali Congress has recently nominated her as a House member under the proportional representation electoral system. So, how this this journey became possible in just seven years? The journey to school When Jubeda Khatun  got married in 1999 , she had to drop out of school because of family pressure. She used to study in grade seven then.  However, after 15 years of the halt, she joined the eighth grade along with her elder daughter Hina Khatun to fulfil her dream to complete her school on the second attempt.  The people who knew Jubeda Khatun used to tease her for going to school with her daughter. “Everyone told me not to study when I failed on the first attempt of taking the final school exams. At that time I would tell them that I would continue taking exams till I succeeded. After all, I don’t mind taking exams even with my grandchildren,” she says. From school to politics The school also became a platform for her to join politics and now the parliament. By the time Jubeda Khatun passed her final school exams, she was already active in social work in the village. After becoming a central member of the Federation of Community Forest Users Nepal ( Fecofun ), she became active in the Nepali Congress politics in 2009. Both her family and in-laws were Congress supporters, so, she easily entered politics. She obtained the party membership in 2006. Her mother-in-law and father-in-law along with her husband Farman Ali Jaga supported her since the beginning of her journey, but society was not in favour of the freedom that Jubeda Khatun was practising. “People from the village used to say many things and they were negative towards me. That’s why whenever I had to go out of the village for programmes and training, my husband would accompany me,” she says, “And, it is my husband who encouraged me to join the school although he himself is illiterate. Khatun says that she reached all the way to the parliament because she has her husband’s support in whatever she does.  Family’s trust matters The family’s trust and confidence in Jubeda Khatun gave her the opportunity to become a representative of the 12th and 13th conventions of the Congress party. A year ago, in the  14th convention , she created history by being elected as the first Muslim woman central committee member of the party. Khatun, who has been achieving one success after another, identifies herself as an ordinary woman. “We are not equipped with everything. I reached here in the course of fulfilling my desire for education and through bittersweet experiences in the journey,” she says.  Now, she plans to use her struggle and success for the benefit of the daughters-in-law of the Muslim community. After becoming an MP, Jubeda Khatun has felt that her responsibility has increased. She says that raising her voice for the education of daughters and daughters-in-law of the Muslim community will be her main responsibility in the parliament. “Otherwise, all of them won’t be able to go through the struggle that I went under,” she says. In 2017, the Nepali Congress put her on the proportional representation list of the Lumbini Provincial Assembly. However, at that time, she failed to get elected as an MP. She did not believe that she would be elected the MP this time as well. But, she thinks the party has given justice to her this time.

This comes after Thapa received support from senior party leader Shekhar Koirala. Koirala and Thapa held discussions about this on Monday and Tuesday before reaching an agreement. Nepali Congress had given those interested until 3 pm on Tuesday to file their nominations to lead the parliamentary party. The election will take place at 8 am on Wednesday. Thapa has been stating  he wants to be the prime minister  prior to the elections. As soon as he won his constituency, he started preparing for the parliamentary party election. As the ruling alliance has almost majority seats in the newly elected House of Representatives and the Nepali Congress is the biggest party in the alliance, its parliamentary party leader is expected to become the next prime minister. Party insiders say Deuba is highly likely to win the election, but the Koirala-Thapa faction hopes to get some support from a few lawmakers from the opposing faction and turn the tables.",political
"New lawmakers’ oath ceremony on Thursday, says Parliament Secretariat","Kathmandu, December 19 The Federal Parliamentary Secretariat has started the process to administer the oath of office to  newly elected members  of the  House of Representatives . Sources say the oath-taking ceremony will take place on Thursday. Lawmakers who want to take the oath in their mother tongue should inform the Parliament Secretariat beforehand. The process will move ahead once the president administers the oath of office to the senior-most member of the House, after which the member will administer the oath of office to other members of the House. It is likely that Pashupati Shumsher Rana will administer the oath of office to other lawmakers. Beginning the new government formation process, President Bidya Devi Bhandari  has called members elected to the House of Representatives  to submit a claim to become the country’s prime minister by soliciting support from the majority of members.

New government in Nepal: President calls parties to claim premiership in 7 days,"Kathmandu, December 18 Beginning the new government formation process, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has called members elected to the  House of Representatives  to submit a claim to become the country’s prime minister by soliciting support from the majority of members. As the House  does not have a majority under the command of a single party , the president issued a call to forge alliances to make a majority and claim the premiership as per article 76(2) of the constitution. The parties have been given seven days to make the claim. Once the parties submit a candidate for the prime minister with evidence that s/he can get the majority support in the House, the head of the state shall appoint him/her to the position and form a new government under his/her leadership. The prime minister then is required to prove the House’s confidence in his/her government in the next 30 days. It is highly likely that the  current ruling alliance  will form the new government. There are debates over who should be the premier, but current PM Sher Bahadur Deuba has a higher chance of retaining the position. Nepal held elections of the House of Representatives on November 20, whose  final results were submitted to President Bhandari  by the House of Representatives just last week.",political
Parliament Secretariat adopting e-attendance to make MPs give more time in House,"Kathmandu, December 18 The  Parliament Secretariat  is preparing to put an e-attendance system in place to discourage the trend of lawmakers’ lack of participation in the parliamentary committee meetings.  According to Secretariat Spokesperson Rojnath Pandey, the preparations are on for introducing e-attendance aimed to make lawmakers procedurally bound for spending the required hours in parliamentary committee meetings. National Assembly Chair Ganesh Prasad Timilsina has already directed the Secretariat to manage the electric attendance. A  lack of quorum  at the meeting of the parliament and the parliamentary committee has often taken place, resulting in the postponement of the meeting. Lawmakers have often refrained from taking part in committee meetings citing various personal reasons. This has resulted in a lack of in-depth discussions while discussing bills and drafting laws.  Lawmakers have also been accused of taking part in events held by non-government and private organisations rather than attending parliamentary committee meetings. “Participation of parliamentarians in programmes hosted by any non-governmental organisation is an old persisting problem. The parliament should release names of lawmakers who didn’t attend meetings resulting in the delay of drafting or amendment of an act,” said Ram Narayan Bidari, a former member of the National Assembly. E-attendance system aims to track the lawmaker’s activities, thus helping sort out these problems. The data shared by the parliamentary committees shows that except for former PMs Madhav Kumar Nepal, Dr Baburam Bhattarai and Jhalanath Khanal, other top leaders’ parliamentary attendance is discouraging. “The scant presence of lawmakers in the parliament and parliament committee meetings is a problem. In many instances the meetings had to be suspended due to the lack of the required quorum,” said Bishal Bhattarai, UML’s former chief whip.",political
Do the results of the federal elections 2022 motivate a new political wave in Nepal?,"On November 20, 2022, eligible Nepalis all around the country cast their votes to elect the 275 members of the  House of Representatives . This general elections will result in the formation of the new  government,  with the selection of 165 members from single-member constituencies via the FPTP system and 110 members from a single nationwide constituency via party-list proportional representation system. Alongside the parliamentary elections, provincial elections also took place. The counting of the votes has been completed. The new administration has yet to be sworn in. The results of the federal elections in 2022 show that Nepali might have reached conscience not to follow those big names and discourage nepotism. However, only time will tell whether the newly appointed representatives bring a new political wave to Nepal. Critical analysis of federal elections 2022 According to the count published by the Election Commission, the Nepali Congress secured 32 seats for the party and 57 seats for the constituency, making it the leading party with a total of 89 seats. The Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist–Leninist (CPN-UML), followed by winning a total of 78 seats—34 seats for the party and 44 seats for the constituency. The UML suffered a loss of 43 seats compared to the last general elections in 2017. The, CPN-Maoist Centre and Janata Samajbadi Party suffered losses whereas Rastriya Prajatantra Party gained. Meanwhile, the newly formed Rastriya Swatantra Party was able to win 20 seats, making itself the fourth-largest party after the elections. The party won 13 seats for the party and seven seats for the constituency. The success of the party with a non-partisan president and shared beliefs shows a new change in the Nepali political society and in the mindset of the citizens. Other newborn parties that managed to acquire some seats in the elections this time are the Janamat Party (6 seats) and the Nagrik Unmukti Party (3 seats). Also, the independent  candidates  with no political parties managed to take five seats. No party was able to gain a majority. Still, the Nepali Congress secured the most wins. In the local elections held in six metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolitan cities, 276 municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities on May 13, 2022, a similar pattern was seen. The majority of seats were secured by the Nepali Congress with 13,773 wins, followed by the CPN-UML with 11,929 wins. The CPN-Maoist Centre secured 5,045 seats, and the Janata Samajbadi Party was able to come in the fourth place with 1,548 wins. The independent candidates managed to win 385 seats. In the local elections, the UML was able to gain the most victories in Province 1, but the rest of the provinces had Nepali Congress in the majority. The possibility of a new wave  Overall, in all the federal elections 2022, the Nepali Congress proved to hold the popularity card. The communist parties suffered a slight setback in the three tiers of the elections. Several alliances were formed and broken. It was as if the communist emergence had faced significant turbulence within their own community. Similarly, the old faces in Madheshi politics were finally replaced in this elections by the new faces of CK Raut and Mahindra Raya Yadav. This year, the Nepali citizens made their stances distinct in regard to the cases of Bina Magar, the daughter-in-law of Pushpa Kamal Dahal; Manushi Yami Bhattarai, the daughter of Baburam Bhattarai and Hisila Yami; Mohammad Firdosh Alam, the son of Mohammad Aftab Alam; and a few others who lost the elections. Nepotism in politics was always there, but this year’s federal elections did not blindly favour all those big names. But alas, it is not that easy to change a whole generation’s beliefs, and so a few candidates managed to climb up the familial ladder. However, society is dynamic, and the candidacy of people from various professional backgrounds in the federal elections displays an unusual or new  wave  in politics.",political
Chitra Bahadur KC and his exceptional life as a lawmaker in Nepal,"If anyone tells you that a former chair of a political party in Nepal lives in a dera (not a sophisticated flat, but a room or two to live a basic life), you probably would not believe them. But, it is a true story and it is the story of Chitra Bahadur KC, the once chair of Rastriya Janamorcha.  After winning the recent parliamentary elections from  Baglung-1 , KC is currently residing in his Kapan-based party office. But, he is currently looking for another place nearby, one that is affordable. His journey to look for a place to stay is as interesting as his life. His first innings Chitra Bahadur KC, now 80, is a household name among the public following parliamentary politics. Some know him as a revolutionary, a critic of federalism, and an orator.  Born in Galkot of Baglung, KC came to Kathmandu with his father when he was 14. His political journey also started when he was 14 with a membership in the Communist Party.  His father was working as a cook in Baglung. When Kunwar Indrajit Singh became the prime minister and overthrew the king of Galkot, a team of locals with his father came to Kathmandu to request King Mahendra to retain the system there.  The group first walked to Pokhara and then boarded a plane to Kathmandu that cost them Rs 60. They submitted their request but did not get the results. When they were returning, the king then requested KC’s father to leave the boy behind, promising that he would get the necessary education here. KC’s father agreed to it for his education and to leave a representative behind for the pending request. But, Chitra Bahadur KC was not admitted to any school. For the next six months, he washed dishes in the palace. “I only got to smell the food being made. On our plates, we would only get rice and gundruk,” writing a letter to his mother, KC explained everything and said that he did not want to continue the work.  The concerned mother sent KC her dhungri (a pair of earrings) to sell and get some money. So KC came out of the palace to sell it and never went back. Then with the money, he got himself admitted to Nandi Ratri High School.  Then, he began renting a dera one after another. “That time, the rent was Rs 5 a month. I used to share a flat in Narayanchaur of Naxal with my friends while I stayed there for my intermediate and bachelor’s degrees.” But in 1969, when the government gave orders to arrest him, he fled Kathmandu and went into hiding.  Shaky second innings Chitra Bahadur KC boycotted the 1991 elections. He lost the next round of elections in 1994. Then, in 1999, he won the elections and again entered Kathmandu. This time, he started living in Ghattekulo, in a rented room. He spent around two decades there.  “The owners changed three times, but I was still there, stagnant. The rent was Rs 1,000 a month at first, but when I left, it was Rs 9,000.” He also won another election in 2013 and continued the dera life. In 2017, he did not get a seat in the parliament, hence he left his rented space too and he went to live with his daughter in Bhairahawa.  Chitra Bahadur KC also has two sons, one in Japan and another here. Neither have their own house in the city.  “For two elderlies, living–even surviving–in Kathmandu became tough.” His wife is 75 years old.  When he reached Bhairahawa, KC shared that he had given up on getting back into the parliamentary game and even promised to not return to Kathmandu. But seeing the country go into chaos and instability, he decided to run for the elections again this time. After winning the November 20 elections, he is back in Kathmandu. Residing in the party office, for the time being, he is now searching for another room to live in. But now, inflation has worried him.  Outlier, through and through  In 2015, Chitra Bahadur KC was a deputy prime minister and minister for cooperative and  poverty alleviation . Yet, he was unable to alleviate his poor economic condition. He is living proof that politicians cannot earn or change their lifestyle without getting their hands dirty.  “When you are a minister, people have a notion that you are there to earn money. But did I become the minister to fill my pockets with black money? I never got tempted to do so, and nor will I be now.” As a member of parliament, Chitra Bahadur KC gets Rs 18,000 monthly for rent. And, he is seeking a room around the Baneshwor area that comes within his budget and still saves something. “But any liveable place here costs Rs 40,000 in rent alone.” Given the parliament building is in Baneshwor, he does not want to stay far from there. The government is building a new structure inside Singha Durbar. Even when the new parliament starts its meeting in the new building, KC wishes that he gets a room nearby so that he does not have to ride the public vehicle to get anywhere.  His political party has repeatedly requested him to ride a car, but he has never heeded. He is popularly known as the politician who walks or rides tempo (a three-wheeler) to work “like the people he is representing”.  This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Writ filed against Rabi Lamichhane calling for his removal as lawmaker,"Kathmandu, December 14 A writ petition has been filed at the Supreme Court against  Rastriya Swatantra Party  chair Rabi Lamichhane asking the court for his removal from his post as a lawmaker of the House of Representatives.

Ministry of Finance agrees to remove 30-year service period in Nepal Police,"Kathmandu, December 14 The  Ministry of Finance  has given the green light in principle to abolish the 30-year service period in Nepal Police. Finance Minister Janardan Sharma told Onlinekhabar that he had agreed in principle to remove the 30-year provision in the police. “I have been saying that the 30-year service period in the Nepal Police should be removed since I had become Home Minister”, Sharma said. “Therefore, we have agreed in principle to remove the service period.” The Supreme Court had ordered to regulate retirement, career etc. only by making provisions in the Police Act. However, the caretaker government is planning to remove the 30-year service period by amending the regulations. Sources claim that the caretaker government of Sher Bahadur Deuba is bringing such a provision to ensure Dhiraj Pratap Singh continues as the inspector general of police (IGP). A source says Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand is not pleased by this decision. After receiving approval from the Ministry of Finance, a proposal has been submitted Ministry of Law and the Public Service Commission after which it will be put forward at the Council of Ministers. “This process is not as easy as it is rumoured,” an officer of the police headquarters says. The caretaker government has recently been scrutinised for bringing the  ‘National Criminal Procedure Code Amendment Ordinance’ to release Resham Chaudhary .",political
Cholendra Shamsher Rana’s forgettable reign as chief justice has a lot of lessons for the future,"Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana retired on Tuesday.  Rana, who took the oath of office on January 2, 2019 , stayed in office for nearly 33 months. However, during his tenure, not only did he fail to fulfil his promises, he  tarnished his and the judiciary’s image in front of the public . Many argue, his image was not the best when he was  recommended to be the chief justice by the Constitutional Council . But, not many had thought it would worsen during his tenure as chief justice. Sadly, it did. After his appointment, Rana intensified the on-site inspection in some places, took action against some judges and even suspended some of them. His initial message was simple: he wanted to do good and emphasised a need for a good team within the Supreme Court. But, that did not last long, because as soon as he got comfortable, he started to show his true colours. Some senior lawyers who knew his nature and character from the inside predicted that Cholendra Shamsher Rana would remind the country of the Rana regime that ruled Nepal with an iron fist for over 100 years. The senior lawyers saw how Rana, instead of focusing on institutional reforms, only did things that benefitted him. What started when he got into the Supreme Court in 2013 became even more rampant when he became the chief justice in 2019. Problematic precedents Cholendra Shamsher Rana’s first year in office was not controversial. Even though some decisions were, they never surfaced, which gave him the confidence to do as he pleased. Sources at the apex court say that Rana always kept a keen eye on issues related to tax disputes, corruption charges and major financial disputes. In the  impeachment motion pending in the House of Representatives , he is even accused of intervening in a case involving his brother Prabhu Shamsher Rana and other relatives. Even in cases ranging from electricity regulation licences to fake VAT bills, Rana formed benches on his own in a bid to make favourable judgments. He even intervened in a case pending in the special court. In the  Lalita Niwas case , he ordered the police to arrest the accused. But, he is also facing an accusation that he tried to bargain with those accused in the case. Ranjan Koirala’s case is another example, in which Cholendra Shamsher  Rana cut short his sentence . The Supreme Court, on review,  later overturned the verdict . Rana even stated that he  regretted that decision . The Ncell capital gains tax case was another one in which he and his bench of justices gave the company a heavy discount.  Supreme Court had ordered Ncell  to pay Rs 38 billion capital gains tax to the government. But, Rana and his bench of justices  offered Ncell a heavy discount as it only had to pay Rs 21 billion . Due to all-around pressure, Rana, who ruled in favour of the state in the fake VAT bill case, later put pressure on the justices who were hearing the review petition. During his tenure, Cholendra Shamsher Rana was also accused of pressuring a district judge to release a rape accused. Interestingly, the judge who gave such an order was later promoted to the High Court. Nepal Bar Association  President Gopal Krishna Ghimire says that even though Rana’s tenure is over, a clear message should be sent so that these incidents will not happen again. “That means that the parliament should address the impeachment motion pending in the House of Representatives and give instructions to the state agencies to investigate him,” he says. Bending the rules When Cholendra Shamsher Rana was proposing to reduce Ranjan Koirala’s jail term according to the  Prison Act 1963 , Justice Tej Bahadur KC suggested otherwise. But not listening to his colleague, Rana tried to force it. “As soon as I saw the script of the verdict written by him, I got angry. The last paragraph was arranged by me,” says justice Tej Bahadur KC. If you follow the court verdicts after Cholendra Shamsher Rana entered the Supreme Court, it would be difficult to find a decision in which he established jurisprudential recognition. “He never wrote opinions. We can maybe count the ones he did on one hand. He always asked others to write opinions on his behalf, even the ones that were wrong and in his favour,” says a sitting justice of the Supreme Court. Although the chief justice was automatically a part of the constitutional bench, he did not write opinions even in the cases there.  “He writes judgments like Ranjan Koirala’s, which no one else can write,” says a Supreme Court justice. Among the three justices who entered the Supreme Court at the same time as Rana, Gopal Parajuli was one of the best in terms of understanding the case; he was good at criminal cases. But, his time was cut short after he was  sacked,  as it was found that he had faked his date of birth to remain in office. Deepak Raj Joshi, who succeeded Parajuli, could not command the bench even though he had a professorial background. Cholendra Shamsher Rana, who only had a bachelor’s degree in law, was clever and adaptable in other matters, but weak in legal theory.  Managing the court More than half of the justices appointed by Cholendra Shamsher Rana during his tenure had controversial backgrounds. Experts say that their performance is not above average. He did not rely on qualifications and abilities while recommending justices for the Supreme Court, many argue. Some of the judges appointed to the High Court did not even have the basic qualifications. The appointment of Renuka Sah, a daughter of former Chief Justice Ramkumar Prasad Sah,  was annulled by the Supreme Court after some time . Some of the judges appointed by Rana were also accused of being used in his vested interest. The Judicial Council is investigating some of them. Cholendra Shamsher Rana even institutionalised the tradition of nepotism in the appointment of judges. When the name of a legal practitioner came up on the recommendation of the then government, he replied, “If they bring the youngest, I will also bring so-and-so”. And, he did it too. Even though the case against the same judge, which was basically questioned, was sent by Rana to a bench of his choice and settled. Advocate Om Prakash Aryal comments that the culture of nepotism became more institutionalised during Rana’s time.  “It’s not that there was no appointment of judges based on nepotism before him, but the way it happened in Rana’s time is quite disgusting,” says Aryal. “It was like Rana was a businessman and not a chief justice because whatever he did during these 30 or so months was all for his personal gain.” Cholendra Shamsher Rana could not even make his secretariat free of controversy. It was alleged that the staff of the secretariat was being mobilised for his own ‘advantage’. A relative of an employee working in the secretariat was made a constitutional official. He was accused of appointing people to pay back his dues by stepping on rules and procedures.  You scratch my back, I scratch yours One of the most serious accusations against Cholendra Shamsher Rana is that he took advantage of his position and bargained with the government and wanted his share in the appointment of high-ranking government officials. When KP Oli was in power, Rana took a lot of benefits from him as he even got a share in the constitutional body.  A former attorney general says that Rana asked for a share in the appointment of ambassadors. But, Oli refused. It was after that incident that Rana started to issue interim orders on cases that would be bad for Oli and his aides.  “The orders given out by Rana during that time were very unnatural,” says the former attorney general. During his defence against the impeachment motion, Cholendra Shamsher Rana revealed he tried to help the then Prime Minister KP Oli in dissolving the House of Representatives both times. But, other justices did not help him. He stated that he asked Oli to impeach the other four judges as well.  After the House of Representatives was restored, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba became the prime minister. Rana played an  important role in reinstating the House . And in return for that, his relative Gajendra Hamal became a minister. But,  Hamal had to resign  after the news got out of Rana’s involvement.  Cholendra Shamsher Rana used political affiliation and self-interest in the case under consideration in the Supreme Court and delivered wrongful verdicts. He was aided by senior leaders of political parties too as they felt they needed to protect Rana who was helping them. Rana pleased the Maoists by giving a  clean chit to businessman Govinda Batala . He was also used by Oli and the UML when the court decided to  split the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party . Rana also issued an interim order telling the main opposition UML party not to take  action against lawmakers Sharada Bhatta and Som Prasad Pandey  who wanted to join the newly formed Unified Socialist party. Let this be a lesson Damodar Prasad Sharma became the chief justice a decade ago when the then  Chief Justice Khilraj Regmi became the de facto prime minister of Nepal  from 2013 to 2014.  Under the leadership of Sharma, the Judicial Council including the senior-most justice Ramkumar Prasad Sah, Law Minister Narahari Acharya, members Khem Narayan Dhungana and Upendra Keshari Neupane recommended the judges of controversial backgrounds to the Supreme Court. Gopal Parajuli, Deepak Raj Joshi and Cholendra Shamsher Rana, who went to the Supreme Court at the same time, have all left the apex court with eggs on their face. The then-law minister Acharya insisted on taking Rana, who was known to be energetic and opportunistic and was a close aide of the Nepali Congress. Acharya had said the court needed a ‘democrat’ like Rana. But, the decision has come back to bite the judiciary hard.  During the parliamentary hearing, Rana said he would leave the post with grace and not do anything to tarnish his reputation. This, to many, including those at the apex court, feels like a joke.  Advocate Aryal says that by learning lessons from Rana’s tenure, the future leadership should stop external interference in the judiciary. According to him, external parties are always trying to influence the judiciary and judges as much as possible. “Previous chief justices have also admitted that such an attempt was made,” says Aryal, “During Rana’s time, politicians were invited to the judiciary and decisions were made in their favour. This needs to be stopped as we can’t accept this under any circumstances.” Former justice Ekaraj Acharya comments that the bad chapter of the judiciary has ended with the retirement of Cholendra Shamsher Rana. “The House should have come up with a decision to impeach him or not. This was a dark phase and the country should learn from it,” says Acharya. This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Doctored images and out-of-context videos spread misinformation during Nepal elections,"On November 19, a day before  Nepal’s general elections , social media users were bombarded with misinformation, which experts described as a sophisticated operation that could threaten electoral integrity. A series of bogus screenshots circulated on Twitter and Facebook on that day even as Nepal was observing the so-called silent period–a period when candidates are prohibited from campaigning, as per the  electoral code of conduct .  Social media users shared a  screenshot with claims  that it showed a fact-check by the Indian fact-checking outlet,  Vishvas News . “Fact Check: Election Results Favor KP Oli: Indian Special Task Force Arrives in Nepal,” the report’s headline said.  While the screenshot, in Hindi, featured grammatical errors, indicating a false claim, a quick search through the website of the Indian fact-checker revealed that the report hadn’t been published. The day of the fake screenshot was far from over. On the same day, social media users shared  images of a news report  purportedly from a secret circular issued by the ruling Nepali Congress asking its supporters not to vote for coalition partner CPN Maoist Center’s candidates. The screenshots claimed several digital outlets and a newspaper had published news reports based on the circular. However, the claim was debunked by fact-checkers as well as the concerned news sites. The fabricated content was widely circulated to mislead people about the ruling electoral alliance between the Maoists and the Nepali Congress.  “It was a deliberate attempt to foster dissatisfaction with the alliance,” said Harsha Man Maharjan, a media scholar at the Kathmandu-based think tank  Martin Chautari . “The campaign appeared to be a work of an organised group.”  Research has shown that online misinformation campaigns peak during elections. Misinformation plagued the 2020 presidential elections in the United States of America. In the Philippines’ presidential election this year,  Bongbong Marcos , the son of Ferdinand Marcos who ruled the country with an iron fist in the 1970s and 80s, triumphed following a disinformation campaign that sanitised the family’s history and painted a negative picture of his opponent.  Six key actors—political parties and campaigns, hate and other extremist groups, foreign governments, domestic governments, commercial actors and non-independent media—engage in election information manipulation, according to an  election misinformation playbook  published by the National Democratic Institute.  “Political parties and their supporters apply various strategies to influence voters. This is usual throughout the election season. This time, however, popular media outlets were exploited to disseminate falsehoods,” said Maharjan of Martin Chautari. “It appears that the effort was orchestrated by people with strong IT expertise.” During the campaign for the November 20 election, social media users disseminated  doctored photographs of politicians  and exploited out-of-context video clips to confuse voters. An eight-year-old video footage showing Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ being rushed to his vehicle in Kathmandu after his security came under attack was  falsely shared  as an attack against him in Gorkha district. While politicians themselves spread lies and propaganda, they are often at the receiving end of misinformation campaigns. A video clip of an interview with UML’s Pradeep Gyawali was trimmed and  circulated to show  he encouraged making false promises to voters during elections.  A study has found that traditional media are no different when it comes to spreading misinformation. A 2021  study by Media Action Nepal  found that 1,817 of the 49,051 news articles it surveyed included false or misleading information. The findings of Nepal’s fact-checking platforms show that news media has been a major transmitter of disinformation due to a lack of verification in the reporting process. Mohan Mainali, a former editor of  South Asia Check , Nepal’s oldest fact-checking website, said election news reports claimed UML provincial assembly candidates in Kathmandu were found to be handing out money to voters.  “However, the reports turned out to be false. They were published on the day of the polls,” he said. “The election season is a time of fierce competition among political parties. They attempt to influence the news. So journalists must exercise extreme caution when dealing with such news.” The fabricated content that spread ahead of the polls appeared sophisticated, according to Maharjan. “There’s a lesson here for Nepali news media. They must be aware that they may be a target of propaganda,” he said.  Maharjan proposes a two-pronged method to address the misinformation problem. “First, we need to expand the digital literacy campaign on a national level,” he said. “Second, for news media to be trustworthy, they must check facts before publishing rather than be driven by emotion in their news coverage.” first appeared on Nepal Check",political
Caretaker government brings ordinance to release Resham Chaudhary,"Kathmandu, December 12 The caretaker government has brought an ordinance to release Resham Chaudhary, who is  serving life imprisonment  for his involvement in the Tikapur incident. The meeting of the Council of Ministers held on Sunday has decided to bring an ordinance to amend Section 116 of the  National Civil Procedure 2017 . This will provide amnesty to anyone convicted of evil crimes. “We have not said amnesty but we want to remove his name from the negative list. We’re still working on a language,” a minister told Onlinekhabar. Section 116 of the  National Civ il (Code) Act 2017 states that cases of people who were involved in killing people in an inhumane manner could not be pardoned. It was due to this legal provision that the government has not been able to release the likes of Resham Chaudhary and other leaders of splinter groups like the Netra Bikram Chand-led Nepal Communist Party. “This feels like a game Sher Bahadur Deuba and others are playing to form a government,” says a source close to the ruling alliance. The parties in the ruling coalition are trying to get the majority in the House of Representatives to form a new government. For that, they will need help from Chaudhary’s  Nagarik Unmukti Party . The top leaders of the ruling party personally visited Resham Chaudhary in Dillibazar jail after the election. But the party has time and again made it clear that it will only support the government if their leader Resham Chaudhary is released from prison and the case against him is withdrawn. A minister said that the government is trying to address the condition of the Nagarik Unmukti Party by deciding to bring an ordinance on Sunday. “If the ordinance is issued, the Resham will be released. But the court should also accept it, I don’t know whether the court’s consent has been taken or not,” said the minister. The government’s decision has been widely criticised from all fronts. Nepali Congress General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma has condemned Deuba’s decision and called him out for not holding discussions within the party. “It is completely wrong to make such a decision during the transition period. This will not only raise political and legal questions, but it will also pose moral questions,”  he wrote on Twitter . Former justice Balram KC says it is clear that the government brought the ordinance for political interests and power. “The president should stop this ordinance because this will bring a lot of chaos,” he says. KC says the current government was doing the same as they accused the former KP Sharma Oli government of doing – ruling through ordinances. Deputy General Secretary of UML Pradeep Gyawali says that the ordinance was an insult to the public’s opinion. “This is a political fraud, an insult to public opinion,” Gyawali told Online Khabar. “I believe that the president will take care of such matters.”",political

"CJ Rana impeachment cancellation: Put it on hold, says Supreme Court","Kathmandu, December 9 The  Supreme Court  has told its administration among other concerned parties to not implement a recent decision of the Federal Parliament Secretariat to  end the ongoing proces s about the proposed impeachment of Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana. It means Rana will remain suspended until the final verdict of the case. Rana is due to retire in the next four days due to his age limit, hence it is almost certain that his bid to get back to the bench will not be possible. A constitutional bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Hari Krishna Karki heard the writ petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association on Friday and issued the interim order as demanded by the petitioner. Meanwhile, the bench also issued a show-cause notice in the name of CJ Rana to explain why the decision to cancel his impeachment process should be considered valid. Rana has been given seven days to respond to the question. Earlier this week, the general secretary of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Bharat Raj Gautam, had sent a letter to Rana stating that the impeachment motion filed against him had been annulled. Rana had submitted an application to the  Parliament Secretariat  requesting his impeachment motion be annulled as the  parliament’s working period was over, without impeaching him . Replying to his application, Gautam wrote to Rana telling him his impeachment motion was annulled. However, the decision turned controversial as the umbrella organisation of Nepali lawyers, the Nepal Bar Association, protested it.  The impeachment motion was  tabled in the House on March 13 , but it was put on hold as the House session was prorogued. As many as 98 had signed the impeachment motion registered at the Federal Parliament Secretariat. With the house prorogued, it was expected that the  motion would not be endorsed, yet he would not return to the office . Earlier, on March 6, the house  formed an impeachment recommendation committee  to study the motion. On February 13, lawmakers of the ruling alliance  filed the impeachment motion  at the Federal Parliament Secretariat demanding the removal of CJ Rana.",political
Indian ambassador meeting major leader raises eyebrows,"Kathmandu, December 9 Indian Ambassador to Nepal , Naveen Srivastava, has intensified his meetings with top leaders of political parties after the elections. This has raised a lot of eyebrows in the country as his visit comes at a time when the  new government is yet to be formed  and many are questioning if India is trying to influence Nepal’s internal affairs. Srivastava met Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba during the vote count and again on December 3. On Wednesday, he went to CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli’s residence in Balkot to meet him. A UML leader says Srivastava went to Oli to congratulate him on winning his constituency and showed interest in the formation of the new government.  Between these two visits, Srivastava also met Maoist Centre Chairman Puspa Kamal Dahal and Vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun. Sources close to these leaders say that Srivastava only talked about contemporary politics and relations between the two countries.",political
Nepal’s new parliament is professionally diverse. What impacts will it have?,"The recent parliamentary elections’  results have already given a clear picture  of what the new parliament will look like. One of the most striking features will be that it will have representatives from different walks of life with professional expertise in various fields. For example, this time, the parliament includes Toshima Karki, a doctor; CK Raut, a scientist; Binod Chaudhary, an industrialist and Rabi Lamichhhane, a media personality. These are just to name a few. The representation of diverse professions in the parliament has been a cause for concern for all about its impact on the betterment of the country. On the one hand, there is anticipation that members of the new parliament will be able to make changes for the better and draft policies for the betterment of the country. But that said, there are also apprehensions that having such diversity could make the legislature challenging to move ahead with key issues.  Advantages For journalist and political analyst Kundan Aryal, such diversity can be considered advantageous as he does not see any disadvantage in having people from diverse professions in the House. He says such a situation brings the voice of different walks of life to the law-making process. The lawmakers who hold expertise in specific professions can clearly bring out the issues and solutions of the sector they are related to, he hopes.  Echoing Aryal, political analyst Uddhab Pyakurel says, “They also have the ability to bring the “real” issues of the specific sectors that could otherwise be overshadowed by the issues of the elites.”   While concerns are there, Nepal’s parliament has a long history of including representatives from diverse professions. That is why analyst Pyakurel does not expect much from this new parliament. Disadvantages Despite the advantages, handling such a diverse, hence divided, House could be challenging, according to observers.  Pyakurel fears the new lawmakers representing different groups, once elected to the powerful positions, might show indifference to the issues they went through while working as professionals. Likewise, another challenge is the party’s whip that restricts them from honestly presenting the problem of their own sector, says Aryal.  According to Aryal, the party’s whip detaches them (the MPs) from professional wisdom and disallows them to present their expertise. They get themselves stuck as just a party cadre.  “For instance, even the CPN-UML MPs with a background in the legal sector were forced to defend the  dissolution of the House by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli ,” says Aryal, also a former advisor to Oli.  However, both analysts believe that some MPs have made an honest effort to present the problem of the specific field in the previous parliament.   Both of them also agree that lawmakers in the new parliament belonging to the business sector might get themselves involved in  decisions that amount to a conflict of interest . While there were such incidents in the past, the new parliament is more vulnerable to that, according to them.  For instance, during Sushil Koirala’s reign as the prime minister, Tek Bahadur Gurung, who owned a recruitment agency, was made the  labour minister . During his time, he made some popular decisions including free visa and ticket provisions for workers going to Malaysia and six other countries. But, these six countries did not include Portugal where his employment agency would send people. This time, more than 30 people, who are either industrialists or businesspeople, have been elected to the House. This means, as per both experts, more risks.",political

"Proportional representation votes counted, 7 parties become national parties","Kathmandu, December 7 The count of the  proportional representation votes  of the House of Representatives has been completed. According to the officials at the  Election Commission , the numbers have come from all constituencies as it has determined the number of proportional system seats for each party. Out of the total 10,560,067 valid votes, the UML received 2,845,641 votes, which will give the party 34 proportional seats in the parliament. This will take its total seats to 78. Nepali Congress received 2,715,255 proportional votes, which gives the party 32 seats, taking its total to 89. The Maoist Centre received the third most proportional votes as it received 1,175,684 votes, winning 14 more seats taking its total to 32.

New government in Nepal: 6 things to know about how the administration changes after elections,"With the  completion of the vote count for the directly elected  (first-past-the-post) system of the Nepal elections, political leaders are meeting each other and discussing on how to form the new government. Since no party has a majority this year, there is a lot of confusion about how the new government will be formed. Out of the 165 FPTP candidates, 57 have been elected from the Nepali Congress, 44 from the CPN-UML, 18 from the Maoist Centre, 10 from the Unified Socialist, seven each from Janata Samajbadi Party, Rastriya Swatantra Party and Rastriya Prajatantra Party, four from Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, three from Nagarik Unmukti Party and one each from Janamat Party, Rastriya Janamorcha and Nepal Workers and Peasants Party. Then, five people won the elections independently. As the proportional representation election vote counts are complete, the date for the new government to be formed is approaching near.  But, how will it happen? What is the process? Here is a rundown. 1. Election of MPs under the proportional system After the counting of votes for the proportional system is over, the  Election Commission  will decide how many seats the parties will get on the basis of their votes. If a party does not get even three per cent of the total valid votes, it will not get a single seat under this system. After the seats are allotted to each party, the Election Commission will write to the political parties to send names from the closed list of proportional candidates they prepared prior to the elections. As per the order of priority of the closed list submitted by the parties to the commission, the names of MPs, proportionate to meet the criteria of the designated cluster, should be sent to the commission. Nepal’s law states that at least 33 per cent of the members of the House of Representatives should be women. This is why the commission will write to each party on how many women should be sent to the house proportionately by the party. Election Commission’s assistant spokesperson Surya Prasad Aryal says the commission will send correspondence to the parties in a few days regarding the principle of inclusiveness based on the number of seats and votes polled by the parties in proportion. 2. Submission of the final results to the president Following the finalisation of the final list of the 275 members of the House of Representatives, which includes 165 direct members and 110 proportional representation members, the Election Commission must submit a report with the election results to the President’s Office within a week. Only after the commission presents the details to the president, it is considered official. Then , the commission will also send the details of the elected MPs to the Federal Parliament Secretariat. 3. Calling of the session within 30 days The president has to call a session of the House of Representatives within 30 days of receiving the report with the election results. Article 93 of the constitution provides the president with the right and responsibility of the summoning and proroguing of the session. 4. Election of speaker within 15 days immediately after the oath After the details are sent by the Election Commission, the Federal Parliament Secretariat identifies the senior-most member among the elected members. The Parliament Secretariat sends a letter to the President’s Office identifying the senior-most member and proposes a date for the oath. Accordingly, the president administers the oath to the senior-most member. The senior-most member then administers the oath to the rest of the members. For this, it is customary for the Federal Parliament Secretariat to organise a special event. The first meeting of the House of Representatives will also be convened by the senior-most member. Within 15 days of holding the first meeting of the House of Representatives, the elections of the speaker and the deputy speaker must take place. The provisions related to this are in article 91 of the constitution. 5. New government within 30 days According to article 76(3) of the constitution, a new government must be formed within 30 days from the announcement of the final results of the elections to the House of Representatives. As soon as the president knows the final results of the elections, s/he must begin the process of forming a new government. Article 76(1) of the constitution provides for the formation of a government with a single majority. But since no party has got a majority in this house, according to article 76(2), the leader of the parliamentary party of the party having the support of two or more parties can become the prime minister. Following the call for the government formation by the Office of the President, the leader of the parliamentary party of the party that can command a majority submits the claim to the prime minister and on that basis, the PM is appointed. If a coalition government cannot be formed within a month, according to article 76(3), the leader of the parliamentary party of the party with the largest number of members in the House of Representatives shall be the prime minister. 6. Confidence vote in a month According to article 76(2) of the constitution, the person appointed as the prime minister must seek a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives within one month. There is a constitutional provision that a no-confidence motion cannot be registered for two years after the trust vote.

"Nepal, India discuss resolving the Mahakali embankment dispute","Khalanga, December 6 Officials of Nepal and India have discussed the matter relating to disputes that ensued on Sunday about the construction of an  embankment  in a bordering area between the two countries. Officials of both countries met at the District Administration Office in Darchula on Monday to discuss the embankment being built by India. On Sunday, the locals of both countries got embroiled in a brawl and went on to pelt stones at each other when the dispute escalated. Over half a dozen of locals from both countries were injured in the incident. The locals in Khalanga on Sunday sternly protested against India’s unilateral construction of an embankment to divert the flow of the Mahakali river. The irate locals fear that their settlement could be at risk due to the embankment. They demanded that the construction work be halted immediately. According to Dirgha Raj Upadhyay, chief district officer (CDO) of  Darchula , discussions between officials of both countries centred on the embankment issue and insisted the locals’ lives be put first. Both sides agreed not to construct an embankment immediately at the place where the dispute ensued and construct only in the place where there was no dispute. The Indian side has installed a gabion net some 7 to 10 metres from the site where the embankment was under-construction. The Nepali side requested the Indian side to remove the gabion net immediately.  The Indian side had been accelerating the construction for some days.",political

Political strategists can change Nepal’s election culture. How do they work anyway?,"Bikash Pant was at his cubicle in  Deloitte’s Gurugram office  when he suddenly received a message from  the Indian Political Action Committee  (I-PAC) that read, “Do you want to create a change in society and work with political leaders?” He was 23, and hungry to create change in society. He accepted the offer and left his mundane 9-5 job for something that he now feels fate had planned for him. “Deloitte (a global financial audit company) was a great place, but I felt I wasn’t adding enough value to my skills and before I knew it, I was in Maharashtra creating strategies for  Shivsena  for the  2019 Lok Sabha elections ,” he says. Learning from the likes of  Prashant Kishor  among others at I-PAC, he gained knowledge about how political strategists worked and the need for them in today’s age. Bringing that to Nepal, Pant recently worked as a political strategist for the election campaign of Nepali Congress leader and  industrialist Binod Chaudhary . Using what he learnt in India and adapting the strategies based on the Nepali context, Pant claims he played a major role in Chaudhary’s victory as he defeated Hridayesh Tripathi in Nawalparasi 1 comfortably. Now, with this, he hopes that more political leaders and parties understand the importance of political strategists, which he believes can help change the political landscape of the country for the better. Need of the hour “What we offer are clear plan and strategies that are research-based that will help them communicate with the public and gives them a chance to win.” Pant feels that is the need of the hour now as the people have slowly shifted away from traditional parties as most can no longer connect with them. The rise of people like  Balen Shah ,  Harka Sampang  and most recently the  Rastriya Swatantra Party  is a clear example of how issued-based politics work. And, that is what political strategists offer. “Mass-based politics is slowly dying. It’s dying in India and it will die here too, and as analysts, political strategists come up with plans to ensure issue-based politics is put forward as this not only helps the candidate but also the public as they understand what these candidates can offer,” he says. Another reason for the need for political strategists is to give political leaders the ground reality of what exactly is going on. Usually, a candidate is surrounded by his/her people or “yes men”. Most of these people rarely tell leaders the reality. He says he never has to please the leader. He just needs to tell them what their weakness is and where they can improve. “It’s important to be honest,” he says. “If not, we can’t be on the same page and that will make the entire thing pointless.” Working modality To know the strengths and weaknesses of the leaders, political strategists use surveys. Each time there is an election, Pant and his team go to the constituency and meet people and gather information. This gives them a chance to know where the candidate stands and what can be done to change the perception of the public. “I think when we identify issues that people from particular areas face, we can work towards ensuring how our candidate can solve them. Sure, many issues are policy centric, but many are people-centric and that is what we work towards solving.” The survey also gives political strategists an idea of what type of people live there. This makes it easy for them to prepare speeches for the candidates. Otherwise, in Nepal, you have seen a tendency of leaders to speak whatever they feel like. “Leaders need to connect to the people. Speaking whatever they feel like won’t work as it won’t resonate with people. I believe surveys give us an idea about the demographics of the area and what the people there are like and what issues they have.” And, it worked to an extent in Binod Chaudhary’s case. An outsider in Nawalparasi 1, the industrialist defeated Tripathi, who had been elected lawmaker multiple times from the constituency. Why? He went on the ground, wore the same clothes every day and spoke to people from different areas and convinced them he would bring development to the region. “We went ahead with issue-based politics and the people from the area supported us. We understand that traditional politics do not make sense anymore and voters are more conscious. Surely, you can feed them meat and alcohol like in the past, but those don’t convert to votes as many realised this time around.” Problems of political strategists But, working in Nepal is not as easy for political strategists as Pant had hoped for. In India, things were smooth given he had full support from the party and its various wings. They listened to analysts like him and respected the suggestions given to them. In Nepal, things were different. He was hired by Chaudhary, not by the Nepali Congress, and that meant the support he had hoped to get from the party was not coming. “Many don’t understand what we do. They think we were there to take their place. But, that’s not true; we just want to help them not make the mistakes they have been in the past. Traditional politics is dead and people like me will just help them evolve,” he says. He understood the way of doing politics in Nepal compared to India was different. Even though there are similarities in terms of people’s aspirations and problems, the support political strategists get from political parties in India and Nepal is totally different.  “Moreover, India has a lot of caste-based politics which thankfully doesn’t exist in Nepal. This makes politics here less violent and it’s a good thing.” But, that said, he hopes there are changes brought to the system starting with a lateral entry for professionals as many do not have the time to be active in full-time politics. “We’ve seen how old leaders fared and the noise Rastriya Swatantra Party made. This is proof that we need new faces because people want change.” That said, he does not expect things to change anytime soon. He has realised how different groups within parties were causing problems and for that tradition to change, he believes it is going to take years. “The elections this year have set a good example but more needs to be done for this to change.” For political strategists in Nepal, he hence believes this is just the start. As Nepal is gradually evolving as a democracy, he believes more and more leaders will hire people like him as most realise the importance of data and the need for clear strategies. “We’ve seen how people like Trump, Modi among others have won elections. They didn’t do it by chance; they had a clear plan and all used clear strategies to win. It’s time Nepali leaders did too,” he says.",political
8 things you should know about the 2022 Nepal election results,"As two weeks have been over since  voting on November 20 , almost all Nepal election results have come out. Even though the results of each constituency are a matter of concern for the public as well as the entire country, some particular trends in the Nepal election results have defined the 2022 polls.  If you have failed to notice those affairs, don’t worry. Onlinekhabar has brought up eight interesting things about the Nepal election results that define the polls of this year in many ways.  1. Emergence of Rastriya Swatantra Party  Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) which was established in June this year  got exceptional results  in the recently held parliamentary elections. The party secured seven first-past-the-post seats in the House of Representatives whereas it is likely to add 14 more seats from the  proportional representation  count, which is yet to be  finalised by the Election Commission . Many analysts believe if the new Nepal election results favoured any party, it is the RSP.  2. The downfall of capital communists  In the recently announced Nepal election results, communist parties did not do well in Kathmandu, the capital city district. In fact, they had the worst performance. Among 10 constituencies of the Kathmandu district, only one of them was won by a communist party as Krishna Gopal Shrestha of CPN-UML won the election from Kathmandu 9. If you talk about the Kathmandu valley, it is three out of 15 constituencies, also including Lalitpur 2 and Bhaktapur 1, respectively won by the UML and Nepal Workers and Peasants Party. The figure is a record low in the history of Nepal election results   3. Bhaktapur 2’s long tradition Whereas the Bhaktapur 1 constituency remains an unchallenged stronghold for the NWPP, Bhaktapur 2, since 1994, has a history of  not repeating its representatives to the House.  The tradition continued this time also as UML’s Mahesh Basnet, infamous for his violence-inciting statements, lost the parliamentary seat to Nepali Congress leader Durlav Thapa.  4. No place for nepotism The other interesting thing about the Nepal election results this time was the voters did not  give much place for nepotism . Many  candidates who came from political family backgrounds  were defeated in the elections this time. Bina Magar, the daughter-in-law of Pushpa Kamal Dahal; Manushi Yami Bhattarai, the daughter of Baburam Bhattarai and Hisila Yami; Mohammad Firdosh Alam, the son of Mohammad Aftab Alam, and a few others lost the elections. However, some top leaders have managed to bring their closest ones into the parliament as proportional representative candidates.   5. Change in the Madheshi politics  Madheshi politics had been controlled by similar and old faces for a long time, but now the region is heralding a change. Two senior Madheshi leaders Upendra Yadav and Rajendra Mahato both have been defeated in the elections. CK Raut and Mahindra Raya Yadav have emerged as new leaders for Madhesh.  6. Three new national parties The Nepal election results this time have increased the number of national parties as seven made it to the list. They are Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, CPN-Maoist Centre, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Jantaa Samajbadi Party and Janamat Party. Of them, the Swatantra party and Janamat Party are entirely new forces whereas Prajatantra Party promoted itself to the status of a national party. Madhav Kumar Nepal-led CPN-Unified Socialist and Mahantha Thakur-led Loktantrik Samajbadi Party are unlikely to cross the three per cent threshold in the proportional representation count required to get the recognition. 7. The fall of the yesmen  The Nepal election results this time did not favour the yesmen of the party’s top leaders. The voters ignored the leaders who would support their boss in whatever conditions. Some of the most known yesmen who lost the elections are Dev Gurung of the CPN-Maoist Centre, Shankar Pokhrel, Pradeep Gyawali and Mahesh Basnet of the CPN-UML. 8. Representation of diverse professions  The Nepal election results are interesting to look at also because they brought people from diverse professions ranging from doctors (such as Toshima Karki) to scientists (such as CK Raut) and businesspeople (such as Binod Chaudhary) to journalists (such as Surya Thapa).",political
6 things Rastriya Swatantra Party should do to retain people’s trust,"The  rise of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP)  is the biggest takeaway from the Nepal elections in 2022. Having tentatively 21 seats including seven through the first-past-the-post system and 14 (yet to be decided) through the proportional representation system in such diversified and divided parliament can play a crucial role in making and breaking government as well to advocate its voices and agendas.  Relatively new and amateur in politics, Rastriya Swatantra Party has many dreams and aspirations to uphold. Here are some suggestions for the nascent party so that it can retain people’s trust in it. 1. Stop being populist I recently saw a video in which Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhne was speaking against the  ratification of the MCC grant agreement . Initially, you can take advantage of the outrage of common people saying the party is against the so-called “anti-national” pact. But, it can have a long-lasting impact on your party’s foreign policies and images. 2. Accept the constitution Rastriya Swatantra Party should never vouch for the Hindu nation-state. In a country where 80% of the population is Hindu, a Hindu nation-state will always have a popular vote. I think every MP in the RSP knows that an individual can have religion but a state can never in this era. So, vouching for a Hindu state can earn you some brownie points, but it can be counterproductive in the long run as secularism is firmly engraved in  the constitution . Meanwhile, the party did not take part in the provincial elections, which implied its anti-federalism orientation. But, in reality, the newborn party might not have found good candidates to contest the provincial elections. Nonetheless, it should never have an anti-federalism tendency. The RSP should function well within the framework of inclusive democracy, federalism, and secularism. 3. Be an opposition We lack a rigid and firm opposition in our long parliamentary practices; be the one. Make sure the voices of the ground are heard in the parliament and watchdog the government. Most of your MPs – young and vibrant -might have the desire to be there and change it.  Rastriya Swatantra Party is not in a position to lead the government, so having one or more ministers will have little impact, which will ultimately lead to despair in the public within a short period. Gaining the trust of the people for five years being an opposition will be more fruitful for the next elections. 4. Stop being an activist Activism is a vital aspect of social reform in the field but not in parliament. Most Rastriya Swatantra Party MPs are from the same background, so changing their position from an activist to a lawmaker is a difficult job.  There is a stark difference between an activist and a lawmaker. An activist can only advocate but a lawmaker can change. I saw the RSP president renovating the water supply and monitoring the chemical fertiliser supply status in Chitwan. It might have a first positive impact on the voters, but it is not the job of the MP. As we do not have a clear demarcation of people-elected representatives’ jobs, MPs seem eager to perform the tasks of local representatives. 5. Exercise rigorous democracy within the party Rastriya Swatantra Party members are from various fields and backgrounds. There will be great differences within the party. But, no worries as democracy is all about having dialogues and conversations. Have hot debates; let your opinions be heard, and have a common ideology. Do not let the image of President Lamichhane overshadow your party and its ideologies and policies. Having a rigorous democratic exercise can allure the youth for lateral entries into the party as it seems too difficult in other parties in Nepal. 6. Address the “young” issues Unemployment is a rampant issue, but the unemployment of skilled human resources is a stark one. Rastriya Swatantra Party should address the issues of brain drain and climate change affecting the lives in the Himalayan region. Address the young issues that affect the young people of the country who will potentially be voting for you for the first time. Be a bridge between the unheard voices of young minds in the parliament.",political
Why low voter turnout is threatening Nepal’s democracy,"Voter turnout is one of the crucial metrics of how citizens directly participate in the governance, future and success of their country. Higher voter turnout, in most cases, is a sign of the vitality of democracy while lower turnout is usually associated with voter apathy and mistrust of the political process. Because of its importance, media and civil society actors, as well as many other stakeholders are concerned when citizens do not turn out to vote. They are also keen to understand the reasons behind low voter turnouts We have encountered a  61% voter turnout in Nepal  in recent polls. This rate is significantly lower as compared to the past two elections, which were 77% in 2013 and 78% in 2017. This level of depreciation in voter turnout has not been raised as an issue so far by any public or political or bureaucratic stakeholders in Nepal.  But, it’s time we asked why political parties and stakeholders could not bring enough momentum to synergise voters to take part in the polls and how it is impacting the country’s democracy.  The narrative of numbers  The voter turnout dwindled significantly when the country voted for the second local elections earlier this year as the  turnout rate was around 64 %. The local elections experienced a fall of 10% in voter turnout as compared to previous local elections held in 2017. We have witnessed  the highest ever , as well as the highest ever participation of women voters, in the 2019 India general elections. The numbers are adding up too well when we consider their past trend of participation in election polls. Out of the total 834,101,479 electors, 553,801,801 people cast their vote in the 2014 Indian general elections. There is a rise in approximate percentage despite major political and constitutional events. Even Pakistan witnessed a 66.9% voter turnout. Bangladesh encountered an 80.20% voter turnout in the last general elections. The 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary elections recorded a 71 % voter turnout amidst the Covid crisis. Crucial reasons There are many reasons and factors contributing to this situation of low voter turnouts in Nepal. The  Election Commission  imposed a  stricter code of conduct . It basically shrank people’s constitutional right to freedom of expression. It was drafted with various impractical clauses as neither parties could follow them nor officials could check compliance but it confused most people and stakeholders. The commission also had an agreement with Meta Inc, the mother company of Facebook, to oversee breach of conduct on Facebook. It went hard on the  No Not Again campaign .   The unaddressed aspiration of the public in regard to good governance, stability and sustainable development has been a serious negative catalyst. Political parties failed to make the most of alliance politics. Duality and debate for and against alliance-based electoral participation made the situation worse. Top political forces kept on pushing the public out of their vested interest in power politics and this certainly increased dissatisfaction among the Nepali commoners. The candidacy offered by alliances and major parties was no way better for voters, especially those with  major allegations of corruption , nepotism, and fat-wallet autocrats.  Nepali society is undergoing a major change in the orientation shift towards postmodernism from the concept of modernism with the slight help of globalisation. The issue of survival is now no more of a major concern as people are seeking comfort and convenience. Political parties might need to get back to people to know them better and perhaps it may generate better outcomes. Misinformation menace TikTok is a certain risk like other social media, but it seems to be a major vector in election misinformation and its AI-based algorithms are certainly not good when it comes to election publicity. A digital watchdog, Global Witness and the Cybersecurity for Democracy team at New York University in the US, suggested a strict ban or strict watch against TikTok during the elections. It has been well-reviewed in Europe and US itself that TikTok approved 90% of advertisements featuring election misinformation including ads containing the wrong election date, false claims about voting requirements, and rhetoric dissuading people from voting.  For a vast number of Nepalis, TikTok has already been a primary source of news, but such unwatched posts could have far-reaching consequences. TikTok’s hyper-tailored algorithm can blast random accounts into virality very quickly. TikTok’s video-exclusive content brings up additional moderation hurdles, as artificial intelligence processes may find it more difficult to automatically scrape video content for misinformation compared to text. This certainly served as a hate infuser. It has been feared by most of the idealists of our country that we have shown a tendency towards  the Schadenfreude syndrome . There was an interesting study carried out by researchers titled  Schadenfreude: Malicious Joy in Social Media Interactions , which presented a model of Schadenfreude, pleasure at another’s misfortune, resulting in a typology of cases of this emotion. Four types are singled out: compensation, identification, aversion, and injustice. Even sentiments expressed post elections over social media highly suggest this syndrome. Mitigating measures A remarkable degree of concern has been expressed about the levels of voter turnout in established democracies in recent decades including the giant United States of America itself. The paradox of voting is unsolved. It could be argued that parties are getting closer to each other ideologically in delivery and practice mechanisms, therefore, reducing the benefits of electing one for the government instead of another. This convergence is not at all welcomed by Nepalis. However, we are optimists and we should look ahead to solve this. Socio-economic factors such as population size, population stability, and economic development should be considered first before planning any polls or any sort of participation in it by parties or individuals. Political factors such as the closeness of elections, perception of the political issues at stake, campaign expenditures, and political fragmentation should be accessed and addressed by major stakeholders of power politics. Voting incentives or changes in modality,  adoption of e-voting , and some regulatory provisions could generate higher turnouts.",political

"As Nepal elects a hung parliament after 28 yrs, the ghost of the past haunts stakeholders","According to Chitra Bahadur KC, the chairman of Rastriya Janamorcha, there are many similarities between the political situation in the country in 1991-1994 and now. Both times, the country was torn apart by internal strife within the ruling party. The 1991-94 period was followed by the mid-term elections of 1994 that elected a hung parliament, giving birth to rounds of political instability in the country. Interestingly, the House of Representatives elections held on November 20 have once again elected a hung parliament, reminding stakeholders that what happened in 1994 could be repeated, says KC. “Just as the previous House of Representatives was able to complete its five-year term, the parliament born from the 2022 elections should write a positive history in such a way that what happened in 1994 will be forever forgotten,” says KC. However, he feels that it will not be easy given the composition of the House, in which no party will have a majority. “It means a coalition needs to be formed, which is going to be tough. But we need to show the people that a coalition government can work,” says KC who is an elected member of the House of Representatives from Baglung 1 and is part of the current  five-party ruling coalition . Forgettable actions Following the dissolution of the House by Girija Prasad Koirala, the mid-term elections were held on November 15, 1994. But, no parties contesting the elections won constituencies enough to form the government. The UML won 88 seats followed by Nepali Congress and Rastriya Parajatantra Party which got 83 and 20 seats respectively. To form the government, at least 103 seats were mandatory. The UML and Congress did not even try to make a coalition government. The UML, the biggest party in the hung parliament, then formed a minority government. According to Radha Krishna Mainali, a member of the House then, many people within the UML did not want to form a minority government but as many were hungry for power, they could not stop it. The main idea of the mid-term elections was to form a stable government, but the UML’s decision to form a minority government meant that a stable government was a farfetched idea. The political scenario became even more unstable. According to Mainali, the Nepali Congress and the royal family hated that UML had formed the government. Following this, the Nepali Congress on June 8, 1995, submitted a petition to the palace, demanding a special session. The king agreed and on June 2, 1995, called a special session of the hung parliament. “But after seeing that the government led by him would fall and knowing that the party was still popular, Prime Minister Manmohan Adhikari dissolved the parliament hoping they would get a majority in the mid-term elections,” recalls Mainali. But, the Supreme Court annulled the dissolution saying the possibility of forming a government remained. Even though it tried to dissolve the House, the UML returned to it and even tried to file an impeachment motion against then Chief Justice Bishwanath Upadhyay and Justice Surendra Prasad Singh. On September 5, 1995, a special session of the parliament was held. After the UML’s request to not start the session as the prime minister was undergoing treatment in the hospital was rejected, the UML MPs shouted slogans and broke the microphone. According to Mainali, during the voting on the motion of no confidence against the prime minister, some lawmakers of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party were taken to a hotel and were fed alcohol as UML lawmakers stayed outside keeping guard. “Attractive girls were sent to the rooms of the lawmakers to keep them busy. I saw it through my own eyes,” says Mainali. But, all this went in vain as the UML government did not survive the brunt of the hung parliament. The motion of no confidence against the hospitalised PM was passed. Then, Sher Bahadur Deuba of Congress became the prime minister with the support of RPP and Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Deuba also did many things to save his government. According to KC, Deuba was so desperate that he created 48 ministries to keep everyone happy. But, there were continuous efforts to topple his government also. On December 24, 1996, Deuba faced a vote of no confidence in the hung parliament. But five ministers, stating they were ill, flew to Bangkok a day before Deuba was due to face a vote of no confidence. Almost all the ministers belonged to the RPP. These ministers were even given USD 2,000 in violation of the law that does not allow expenses to be paid to those who go abroad for treatment without the recommendation of the medical board. According to Mukunda Sharma, a former secretary of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives asked the ministers and the chief secretary for an explanation regarding this issue on February 1997. The chief secretary accepted that the amount was given based on the decision of the Council of Ministers. Even though the audit committee concluded that there was an irregularity, it could not make any decision. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority also investigated and on August 5, 1999, it was determined that the ministers had committed political corruption, but it could not decide to file a case on corruption charges. Five governments were formed during the five-year term of the hung parliament. After Deuba, the government was formed under the leadership of Lokendra Bahadur Chand. Kamal Thapa and other leaders of the RPP played a role in toppling Chand’s government, after which it was formed under the leadership of Surya Bahadur Thapa. At that time, Chand made a sharp comment on Kamal Thapa’s character saying, “The rat ran away as soon as he realised that the ship was going to sink.” After Surya Bahadur Thapa, Girija Prasad Koirala of Congress became the prime minister again on April 2, 1998. The government led by him collapsed on December 21, 1998, but he became the PM again two days later. But during this, the member of the cabinet changed several times. There were many attempts to sustain his government. The China Southwest Air charter scandal took place between 1994 and 1999. A commission was formed under the leadership of former secretary Bhojraj Pokharel to investigate after questions were raised that there was an irregularity in the leasing of planes by the Nepal Airlines Corporation for three months from China Southwest Airlines. After that, the Public Accounts Committee of the hung parliament gave the same report as in the  Lauda plane charter case  that there were irregularities in the chartering of China Southwest aircraft. At that time, the UML said it was surprised by the decision of the accounts committee although it was chaired by its own lawmaker Subas Chandra Nembang.  The Prado-Pajero scandal is also memorable among lawmakers during the term of the hung parliament. The government allowed the purchase of expensive SUVs like Pajeros and Land Cruisers with exemptions from customs and sales tax to please lawmakers. After the government gave customs and sales tax exemptions, lawmakers were attracted to the expensive SUVs while other officials and administrators had their eyes on hatchbacks and sedans. It is believed that this caused the country a loss of Rs 550 million and institutionalised corruption in the country through the use of these vehicles. According to KC, expensive cars were white elephants for low-paid lawmakers and staff. Many rushed to the courts to get this decision annulled, but their efforts went in vain. Knowing lawmakers could be influenced through gifts and money, many businesspersons started to get close to lawmakers. There were even cases in which lawmakers were paid to topple the government as the businesspersons wanted people in power who would benefit them. According to the then UML lawmaker Mainali, the 1994-99 hung parliament created extreme distrust in the citizens towards the parliamentary system due to the hooliganism of the leaders who came to power. These actions helped the Maoists rise up. Fear of the future The hung parliament then showed that if no party gets a clear majority, if the party leaders and lawmakers are selfish and power-hungry, political stability could never be achieved. Many fear that the country could follow a similar path following the recent elections. The current political scenario is similar to that in 1994. No party has a majority. But unlike in 1994, this time, there is no third party that can make or break the government. Based on the number of constituencies won in the first-past-the-post system and votes received in the proportional representation system, it seems that Nepali Congress will reach 85-86 seats, UML 78 seats, Maoist Centre 30-31, RSP 21, RPP 14 and the CPN-Unified Socialist 10. Since there are 275 members in the lower house, 138 lawmakers are needed to form a government. Like in 1994, it is unlikely that the two major parties, Nepali Congress and UML, will work together to form a government.  In 1994, the constitution gave lawmakers the right to file a no-confidence motion against the prime minister at any time. But now, that cannot be done for at least two years. This, many parties believe, will bring some stability. But, given what Nepal has seen in the past, this can be violated easily. For example, if the new government in the hung parliament fails to maintain a clear majority in its favour, it will face problems in bringing the budget on May 29, 2023. If the budget fails, the government collapses. To ensure that does not happen, the prime minister, whoever it may be, can bring an ordinance like the one brought by Oli to pass the budget outside the parliament. But, it is not going to be simple as the ordinance also needs to be approved by the parliament within 60 days of the commencement of the session. This means that the government can survive for a few months by gaining infamy, but the government cannot survive. For this, the government has to maintain a constant majority in its favour. It will be interesting to see how different political parties in the hung parliament act in the coming months. There is another major difference. Like in 1994, the prime minister cannot dissolve the house unless there is a possibility to form a new government. According to article 76 of  the constitution , a government of two or more parties is formed when no party has obtained a clear majority. If this is not possible, the largest party will form the government. If this is not possible, the constitution has given the opportunity to any member of the House of Representatives to form the government as an independent parliamentarian. The court has also explained that in article 76, subsection 5 (7) of the constitution, the party whip does not apply when a vote of confidence is given to the prime ministerial candidate who tries to form the government independently. It means the parties have an opportunity to erase the stain of infamy earned by the hung parliament in 1994, according to Mainali.

On November 6, the court issued an interim order in response to a writ petition filed by Premilal Prasad Chaudhary of Tharu Kalyankari Sabha, ordering the government to allocate 6.6 per cent of the civil service seats for them.

Who will lead the new government in Nepal? Here are 3 possibilities,"As the results of the federal elections are coming out from all across the country, a  phone call  from the CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli to his Maoist Centre counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal, possibly about the formation of the new government, caused a hullabaloo. The call made to Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday was a clear sign that Oli needed his support and in the call, he asked Dahal to meet him to discuss working in tandem in the future. The two, who had not spoken to each other after the fall of the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party, speaking on the phone has raised a lot of eyebrows. The phone came at a time when Dahal and the Maoist party, disappointed with how the elections have gone for the party, were looking at options about the next course. Now with the call, a communist alliance is once again on the table. But, will that happen as far as the new government is concerned? Or, will the  newly formed Rastriya Swatantra Party  be the kingmakers? What will happen to the Nepali Congress and the coalition?  Here, we look at three possible equations for the government formation which will turn the politics of the country. The context As of Saturday morning, Nepali Congress has won 49 constituencies and is leading in five. Similarly, the UML has won 38 constituencies and is leading in six. When it comes to proportional representation votes, both UML and Nepali Congress are neck and neck. If the trend continues, Congress and the UML are likely to have around 85 and 80 seats in total respectively. The Maoist Centre will most certainly be the third party in the elections. Contesting the elections and forming a coalition with the Nepali Congress, the Maoist Centre has won 16 constituencies and leading in two. When it comes to the proportional representation votes, the Maoists have received fewer votes than the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which means the Maoists are likely to win 16/17 seats directly and 15/16 via the proportional system, giving them around 30/32 seats in the House of Representatives. Rastriya Swatantra Party won seven seats directly, and will likely win 16/17 seats through the proportional system. Rastriya Prajatantra Party will likely finish as the fifth party as it has won six seats directly and leading in one. It is likely to secure around 8/9 seats from the proportional representation system. But, parties like the CPN-Unified Socialist and Loktantrik Samajbadi are unlikely to meet the threshold to become a national party as the two have won 10 and four seats respectively. Their proportional votes are not great either. These data show both the Nepali Congress and the UML have the chance to form the government. But, reaching a majority of 138 seats as demanded by the  constitution  is not going to be easy as the Maoist, RPP and RSP will hold the key to the new government. Scenario 1: Coalition rules The Nepali Congress wants to form the new government with the current coalition it has formed with the Maoist Centre, Unified Socialist, Janamorcha and LSPN.  It is projected that the NC will win 85 seats, Maoists 32, followed by Unified Socialist, LSPN and Janamorcha with 10, four and one seats respectively. This will take the total seats of the coalition to 132, which is six fewer than what is needed to form the new government. Their only hope is to seek the support of the Janata Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party and Rastriya Swatantra Party. Even if the coalition does form a government, since there are so many people involved, it will have a tough time distributing the power among each other. Why? Both Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre will want their leader to become the prime minister. Even though it is likely that the parties will propose to share the prime ministership, it might not be easy. Not wanting to make the same mistake he made in his partnership with KP Sharma Oli in the previous term, Maoist Centre Chairman Dahal wants to become the prime minister before anyone from Nepali Congress. But, leaders from the Nepali Congress do not want this.  Some Nepali Congress leaders say that Sher Bahadur Deuba might agree to this if the coalition agrees to make a Nepali Congress leader the president of the country. This will not be ideal for Deuba as  Gagan Thapa wants to become the prime minister himself  and will challenge Deuba to become the parliamentary party leader. Thapa will be  supported by Biswa Prakash Sharma . Senior leader Ram Chandra Paudel also wants to become the prime minister. Scenario 2: The UML government with Maoists and RPP The UML is likely to win around 80 seats in the House of Representatives. Even though this is not good news for the UML which had set a target of 150, it is even worse for the Nepali Congress and coalition which does not have enough seats to form the new government due to it. This means the UML still has a chance to form the new government, but it will need help from different parties as its coalition with the RPP and JSPN will be enough. Even if it brings the RSP on board, it will not have enough to form the government. Oli did call Dahal to discuss the issue because he knows he will need the Maoists on board. The Maoists were left disappointed with the lack of vote transfer in the current coalition, which has already started to raise issues about whether forming a coalition with the Nepali Congress was the wrong idea. But, even if the Maoist does come on board, the UML-led coalition will not have a majority to lead the government unless the RPP joins this. A leader of the Maoist Centre says the party’s priority is to continue the current alliance, but it cannot completely reject the possibility of forming a new government together with the UML and RPP. Scenario 3: Congress-UML partnership  Even though this type of new government seems a wild idea now, Nepal has already seen weirder things in politics. If the Nepali Congress and the UML come together, they will not need any other party to form the new government. This had happened in the past too. When the Dahal-led government fell down in 2008, the UML and Nepali Congress formed a coalition government. They formed a similar government in 2013 too after the second Constituent Assembly elections. But, the government at that time had the responsibility of coordinating the work of drafting the constitution. Since there was a lot of agreement between the Nepali Congress and the UML on the content of the constitution, it seemed natural to form a government by excluding the Maoists then.  Things are different now. The UML leaders, including Oli, have been continuously giving proposals for political polarisation from the public platform, so they are unlikely to stand together with Congress just to form the new government.

Gagan Thapa-Bishwa Prakash Sharma bond: Can it trigger a generational shift in Nepali Congress?,"After winning as a lawmaker for the fourth time, Nepali Congress General secretary Gagan Thapa has said he will be now preparing to become the parliamentary party leader as the next step to his  Mission PM . His decision immediately received support from the other general secretary, Bishwa Prakash Sharma.  “I will support Thapa and recommend him for the prime ministership,” says Sharma. Sharma, who will be entering into parliament for the first time, has expressed this thought even before the elections.  Likewise, the party’s other youth leader Pradip Paudel has also been elected from Kathmandu-5 as a House of Representatives. He still has not said anything about the parliamentary party leader and future prime minister. But, analysts have already connected Paudel also to the Thapa-Sharma bond with the hope that  the unity among them  could result in a generational shift in the grand old party. But, how possible will it be?   Weighing possibilities It has been learned that old leaders of the party have already been alarmed by Gagan Thapa’s vow to fight for the parliamentary party leader and Bishwa Prakash Sharma’s support in his bid. Hence, they are busy weighing all possible equations for the next government formation.  According to the party leaders, if the current coalition of the Nepali Congress, CPN-Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, Rastriya Janomorcha and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party will get a majority to form a government, Sher Bahadur Deuba will once again be the prime minister.  Apparently, Thapa cannot defeat Deuba in the race to lead the parliamentary party because most of the candidates in both first-past-the-post and proportional elections are from the Deuba faction.  But, if the coalition does not get a majority and the Maoist Centre does not come in as the third party, Gagan Thapa has some possibility to defeat Deuba as the new coalition partners, which will be decisive in making or breaking the government, might pressurise the five-time PM to consider a generational shift.  Urge for an urgent shift Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane has already indicated that he would support a new face for forming the government. This means the  new entrant in the parliament  will not support Sher Bahadur Deuba instead of Gagan Thapa. This has mounted pressure on the NC senior leaders Prakash Man Singh and Ram Chandra Paudel also as they are also vying for the top position.  If the ruling coalition fails to form a government, the CPN-UML may take the initiative. But, it seems the RSP or other independent candidates will only support the party that will introduce a new face for prime ministership.  In such a situation, there will be a dilemma about whether to support the new face of Gagan Thapa to form a government or let the UML take the charge.  As this debate is already taking place within the party, many new lawmakers including Pradip Paudel may support Thapa.  Leaders already cautioned   Hence, some senior leaders of the party have already started holding informal meetings about the future government and equations. According to leaders, Prakash Man Singh, Ram Chandra Paudel and Sher Bahadur Deuba already had a meeting, immediately after Gagan Thapa announced to run for the position of parliamentary party leader. The meeting led by Singh discussed the need for three leaders to go together for the party’s parliamentary leader.  “The three leaders had a discussion that only one of them will go forward for the parliamentary party leader,” says a leader anonymously.  Meanwhile, some leaders have assumed that if Thapa will create a strong atmosphere in his favour, the senior leaders can delegate Pradip Paudel to compete against him (Thapa).  Paudel is considered a strong contender for Thapa. In this case, the senior leaders would attempt to break the bond between Thapa and Paudel and make them vie against each other for the party’s parliamentary leader.  However, Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prakash Man Singh and Ram Chandra Paudel are not ready to hand over the leadership to the second generation. In this context, Pradip Paudel can assist Gagan Thapa.  As the RSP can play a decisive role in forming a government, its party leaders have already reached out to the Congress leaders for a dialogue. Apparently, joining hands for a government is an issue.  This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Left alliance in the making? What did Oli tell Dahal in the ice-breaking phone call?,"Kathmandu, November 25 In a first one-on-one conversation since the split of the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party (NCP) developed from the  left alliance of the 2017 elections , CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli telephoned CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday, asking him to work together to form the government. As the results of the parliamentary elections held earlier this week are coming out, Oli reportedly told him how various forces had worked together to divide them and asked Dahal to meet him to discuss how to take things forward post-elections. Sources say Dahal, in reply, told Oli that his (Oli’s) activities in the past had ended the left alliance yet said he was willing to talk to Oli when the time was right. “We are in the ruling coalition and the  final results of the elections are yet to come . Let’s see what the situation is, then we can talk,” Dahal’s secretariat quotes the leader. Oli’s personal secretary, Rajesh Bajracharya, confirms the two chairs spoke on the phone. “They congratulated each other on their victories and spoke about how to move forward; that’s all. Prachanda (Dahal) said he would get back after looking at the election results,” says Bajracharya. Sources close to Oli tell Onlinekhabar Dahal even commented that the UML party got better results than expected. A source adds that Oli told Dahal how non-political groups were being deployed to weaken the country’s communist movement and asked him to tread carefully. Dahal’s personal secretary, Ramesh Malla, also confirms the two talked on the phone. “He said ‘let’s work together’ but how that is going to happen wasn’t made clear. Other senior leaders of the UML have also called chairman Prachanda regularly,” says Malla. UML vice-chair Subas Nembang and other leaders called Dahal and congratulated him.  After the split of the NCP, Oli and Dahal had not spoken to each other. Two, instead, time and again had indulged in a war of words against each other.  But now, this phone call from Oli suggests that things are going to change in terms of the possibility of a left alliance again.",political
What CK Raut’s presence in Parliament means to the Madheshi politics,"Chandra Kant Raut, alias CK Raut, who frequently  creates buzz in national politics  has made his first federal election interesting as well.   Raut has defeated Upendra Yadav, the most prominent spearhead of the Madhesh movement, to represent Saptari 2 in the House of Representatives. Raut has secured 35,042 votes while Yadav has been restricted to 16,969 votes.  It means CK Raut’s identity will see a sea change as he is elected a member of parliament.  His controversial background While Nepal was going through the insurgency, CK Raut was studying in the USA. He returned to Nepal in 2006. Back then, he formed an organisation called Swatantra Madhesh Gathabandhan.    As the monarchy collapsed, the country entered the new phase of loktantra.  Raut again went back to the USA after forming an organisation. Afterwards, he returned to Nepal in 2012 and published a manifesto that shook Singhadarbar, the central administrative complex, to the core. While the country was having a debate on the provincial system, he came up with an agenda to make autonomous Madhesh.  His protests to make Madhesh autonomous were considered as an anti-national movement by the government. He was  arrested many times . But, Raut, who was holding a secessionist protest, unexpectedly made  an agreement with the government.   After signing the 11-point agreement in 2019, Raut freely stepped into politics. However,  the government was still pessimistic towards him as he was frequently seen discussing referendums.  After an agreement with the government, he formed his own party,  Janamat Party .  The parliamentary journey After forming the party, CK Raut quit the agenda of the referendum. Afterwards, he peacefully started doing Madhesh-centric politics. His involvement in politics has been well received by the public of Saptari 2.  Madheshi political analyst Tula Narayan Sah believes that Raut has emerged as an alternative to Upendra Yadav. The downfall of Yadav has benefitted Raut.  “Yadav’s identity was created by the Madhesh movement, but lately his identity has been weak,” says Sah.  People close to  Raut  believe that his decision to compete against Yadav has made him the new leader in the region.  Analyst Sah says the personality of Raut has made him win elections rather than this agenda. “Madheshi people didn’t have faith in Raut’s agenda, but his personality had a great influence on them.”   Sah says that the Madheshi youth are more inclined towards Raut.  Raut made an effective campaign for the elections. While Yadav was appealing to the people for votes in a traditional way, Raut’s focus was on social media and youth living abroad.  His agenda was also different from other Madhesh-centric parties. While others were talking about Madhesh’s rights, Raut pledged to end corruption and establish good governance.  Sah says that Raut has been successful in changing his past identity. However, it is yet to see whether he will show his lust for power as the previous Madheshi leaders.  This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Rastriya Swatantra Party looks forward to a difficult path. How shall it move ahead?,"The country will soon welcome a new set of lawmakers to its federal and provincial parliaments. Among those elected, there will be some old faces and some new ones. It is with the latter group that people have great expectations.  Balen Shah’s victory  in the mayoral race in Kathmandu has left people believing that change is imminent. The preliminary elections’ results do show that a few untested candidates from the newly formed Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), which has become a safe house for the independents, will find  themselves in the federal legislature . While the possibility of having people who are not cashing in on their jail time and are instead relying on merit to appear as the representatives is positive evidence of the maturation of democracy, a difficult path awaits them. So, how can it deal with it? Subjected to compromises Moving forward, the newly elected representatives of the Rastriya Swatantra Party can no longer rely on the tags of anti-establishment and independence. It will become defunct the moment they step into the parliament. Moreover, accomplishing any monumental legislative change by themselves would not be possible with the number of seats they will have in the parliament. As such, the RSP will need to partner with other parties they disagree with most and begin their parliamentary journey with compromises. Collaboration in the parliament becomes critical for a small party because the legislature is not only a platform to vent dissent—anyone with a cell phone and internet can do so in today’s world. The legislature’s job is to ultimately make decisions, which involve electing the executive body and passing legislation—processes that require taking a side. No matter how many parties, ideologies and interests are represented in the parliament, in the end, one has to take a side. You can either be for something or against it. Not voting is also an alternative, but even that implicitly leans towards either a yes or no. The new entrants of the Rastriya Swatantra Party will have to discard the notion of ideological puritanism if they are to deliver moving forward. The reason for that to happen is that the luxury of being uncompromising in terms of ideas is only available to those who never make it to parliament.   For instance, when the new parliament initiates the process of deciding who is going to be the next prime minister, smaller parties will have a candidate of preference. They prefer either their own party or another depending upon their naivete and parliament composition. It is, however, more than likely that the Rastriya Swatantra Party will have to vote either for or against a candidate fielded by the old parties. Neither the UML nor the Maoists have fresh proposals in mind. Meanwhile,  Gagan Thapa has expressed his interest  in the top job, but it is  unlikely  that he will hold the reins in his Nepali Congress party immediately following the elections. Finding the difference between sloganeering and politicking Electing the next prime minister will be among the first compromises that new representatives from the Rastriya Swatantra Party will have to make. Had they been outside the parliament, they could have issued a note of dissent, held their own hypothetical choices and safeguarded their popularity. But, as soon as they make decisions that need to be made strictly on the basis of available options, their popularity will take a hit. What else can you do when in a multiple-choice question, the answer you have in mind is not even among the list of options? And at that moment, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will realise, if they will have not already, the difference between sloganeering and politicking. Sloganeering is different from politicking because the former makes hypothetical arguments grounded in ideals and not reality. Then, politicking goes beyond dissent and takes into account probability, limitations and the need to make decisions on time based on options that are on the table. If the Rastriya Swatantra Party lets ideological puritanism guide its decisions, the parliament will be a fragmented whole that can never come together to effectively deliver. Inside the parliament, they can be independent, unflinching and ineffective or they can compromise, collaborate and be effective in achieving progress, however marginal. Seizing the opportunity at the cost of popularity From the preliminary results, it is likely that more than two parties will be required to form the next government. Moreover, in the absence of a clear-cut majority, parties that are third or fourth biggest will end up having key votes. The votes in the parliament can provide an opportunity to form the government and head ministries. If the Rastriya Swatantra Party gets presented with that opportunity, irrespective of which old party or parties they have to collaborate with, they should think about seizing it. Even if it comes at the expense of their popularity… This might mean voting in support of legislation they do not fully agree with or supporting candidates they dislike. These compromises might tarnish their temporary reputation, but the thing about legislation is that it can always be amended later on. If the Rastriya Swatantra Party eventually becomes a big party, it can always change the things it dislikes, for instance, its stance on the structure of federalism. But, with their current size, the best they can do is decry. Rather, it will be more prudent of them to lead some executive body, perform well and translate that performance to larger public support. Compromises will disappoint naive party cadres hoping for miracles, but that is part of the process. The other alternative the Rastriya Swatantra Party has is to take the easy way of saying no to everything and staying in the opposition, which essentially means that they would not deliver the majority of their promises mentioned in their manifesto as they require executive initiatives. Politics is a long-run game and involves strategies quite like in a war. And, it is important to know that wars can be won even if a few battles are lost along the way.",political
Sagar Dhakal: Will contest again in Dadeldhura after 5 yrs,"Kathmandu, November 23 Independent candidate Sagar Dhakal  who challenged Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s candidate in Dadeldhura for the House of Representatives seat says he will fight the election after five years in the same constituency.  As of  results made public  on Wednesday morning, Deuba has been reelected to the House,  for the seventh time  since the reestablishment of multiparty democracy in Nepal in 1990, whereas Dhakal, an engineer by training and profession from the Gulmi district, has received 13,042 votes. Yet, social media users have been impressed by Dhakal’s strength as no one has seriously challenged Deuba in his district ever.  In this context, Dhakal spoke to Onlinekhabar over the telephone this morning to say he will give it a try in the next election also.  “I’m not thinking of a single election; I’m looking forward to 10. It means I have planned to be in politics for the next 50 years,” he says, “If you look at my agenda, you can sense that.” The Oxford graduate, however, says he will leave politics if he loses the second election also. “In that case, I will continue engineering consulting. I don’t have any shortage of work. It may sound an exaggeration, but I have already worked with leaders of different countries at Oxford.”  Dhakal also accuses Prime Minister Deuba of misusing the state resources and rigging the elections to make sure he gets reelected.  “Election officers were helpless in front of them,” says Sagar Dhakal.",political
"Nepal elections: Nepali Congress, Swatantra Party likely to become biggest forces in Kathmandu","Kathmandu, November 22 As the results of the Nepal elections held on Sunday are coming out, it seems the Nepali Congress and the newly formed Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) will become the two biggest forces in the capital city of  Kathmandu . In 10 parliamentary seats in the district, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s Nepali Congress party has secured victory in two so far, with Prakash Man Singh in constituency 1 and Gagan Thapa in 4. If early results are anything to go by, Santosh Chalise, Pradip Poudel and Rajendra Kumar KC will win three other seats for the party in the city. The hitherto biggest political force in Nepal’s parliament, CPN-UML, is likely to win just one or two seats in Kathmandu. The party’s Krishna Gopal Shrestha is close to victory in constituency 9 whereas there is some possibility for Shyam Ghimire in constituency 7. The remaining three constituencies (2, 6 and 8) are likely to be claimed by the Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party. Whereas the CPN-Maoist Centre had fielded three candidates on behalf of the ruling alliance, no one has ever led the vote count in their constituency so far. Complete results of the  Nepal elections  are expected in one week.",political

Exit polls show Lamichhane will win the Chitwan 2 constituency with a wide margin. In Kathmandu 7, his party’s Ganesh Parajuli is leading the count. The party is expected to have impressed the voters in Kathmandu’s constituencies 2, 6 and 8 also. In Kaski, the situation is similar as RSP’s Madhav Prasad Kandel is leading UML’s Bidya Bhattarai. Aanalysts expect the party will gain a lot of votes in the proportional representation elections, probably the third after the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML. In the rest of the places, candidates of the ruling Nepali Congress-led and the opposition CPN-UML-led alliances are ahead of other candidates. In Saptari 2, Janamat Party’s CK Raut is leading Rastriya Janata Party’s Upendra Yadav.  Meanwhile, speaking to the media in Chitwan on Monday, Lamichhane said that it would be difficult for mainstream political parties to move forward without taking them along. “Looks like we’ll have a good size and it will be very difficult to move forward,” he said.

The  Election Commission  says all preparations for the voting have been over. Security agencies have confirmed they are on standby across the country to avert any violence during the voting and ensure the process takes place in a free and fair manner.

How not to make your votes invalid while voting: 8 points to remember,"Another round of elections is about to take place in Nepal  on November 20, 2022 . This time, the elections are meant for choosing the next batch of provincial and federal lawmakers. The turnout in Nepal’s elections fluctuates but the number of invalid votes has always been a concern in every election. So, for the November 20 elections, it is every voter’s responsibility to make sure that their votes are clear and valid in order to be a part of the democratic process.  So, to be an informed and responsible citizen, here are a few things you should know and remember while you cast your vote in the November 20 elections.  1. Make sure the ballot paper is not damaged Election Commissio When you reach the voting centre for the November 20 elections and you get cleared for voting by the staff representatives there, you will be handed your ballot paper, one at a time.  As soon as you get the ballot paper, check the ballot paper and make sure that it is in sound condition. Check for damages, tears, or any unclear prints that might jeopardise your votes. Complain to the representatives if you see any problems.  2. Confirm the voting officer’s signature When you enter the booth during the November 20 elections, you will be given a ballot paper to cast your vote. When you receive it make sure that the first thing you do is check whether the paper has the voting officer’s signature. If the ballot paper does not have the signature, your vote will be deemed invalid.  In this round of elections, you will have to  drop your vote in four ballot boxes . You will have to repeat the process in all four of your ballot papers too. Before you cast your vote, check for the signature and prevent your valuable vote from being invalid. 3. Use the swastika stamp only All the polling booths will have a swastika stamp stick and an ink pad, which you can use to indicate your vote during the November 20 elections. This means voters do not have to carry any pen or marker to cast their votes. In fact, voters have to use only the swastika stamp to vote; otherwise, their votes will be considered invalid.  Another major mistake that people tend to make is to cast their vote using their thumbprint, which is also not allowed and will cause your vote to be invalid. So follow this simple code of conduct and make all four of your votes count in the democratic process. 4. Make your stamp clear One more thing you have to think about while voting during the November 20 elections is to make sure that you do not use too much or too little ink. If you do either of the two, it will result in your mark being unreadable and your vote is invalid.  Also, do not smudge the ink or use the stamp twice on the same spot or try to put your stamp twice on the same box. This will have to be followed in all four ballot papers. 5. Do not vote for two candidates/parties Depending on the ballot paper, you will vote for a candidate (first-past-the-post) or a party (proportional representation). And unlike the local elections, voters are required to vote for only one electoral symbol of your desired candidate or party on one ballot paper. Do not cast a vote on two boxes on a single ballot paper. If you put two stamps, it will deem your vote invalid. So, make sure that you are only using one vote and that it is clear to read. 6. Stay inside the box When you cast your vote, another thing you have to consider is to make sure that you indicate your stamp clearly and stay inside the set box while doing that.  If you put your stamp outside the box, you will be turning your valuable vote into invalid. In all four ballot papers, cast only one vote each and make sure to stay inside the box. This also means that you have to indicate your stamp in a way that does not overlap with another box, horizontally or vertically.  You have only one vote so do not end up voting for two candidates or dividing your votes. Hence, make sure it is one per ballot paper and all stamps are clear to read so that your choice will not be ignored as an invalid vote. 7. Fold the ballot paper in a proper way After you cast your vote, you have to drop your ballot paper in the ballot box. In doing so, you have to fold your ballot paper as you will not be able to drop it as a whole. Folding is also necessary here as it will help you maintain the secrecy of your vote. But, how you fold the paper might determine if your vote will be deemed valid or invalid. Do not fold the paper in a way the face of the paper is folded outside and your vote can be seen. Also while folding, make sure that the ink is not smudged or that it makes an imprint on any other symbol on the paper. One way to do it can be to fold it in a way that the part of the paper where you have placed your stamp lies on the (white) back side of the paper.  It is also a good idea to make sure that the ink has dried; for this, just blow into it so that it dries quicker before you fold the paper. It will save you the trouble of finding ways to fold and not mess up your vote. 8. Make sure to go into all four booths As mentioned before, you are voting in four ballot papers–two for the House of Representatives and two for the Provincial Assembly. And, once you will only be done with your first ballot paper, you will get the second ballot paper and so on. [Read the step-by-step guide for the voting day  here .]",political
How to vote today? Here’s a step-by-step guide,"Ready to vote in the parliamentary elections scheduled for today? Or, are you still confused about how to express your choices in the provincial and federal elections this time?  You might have already participated in the  local elections  held on May 13 earlier this year. However, this batch of provincial and federal elections is a  bit different  and slightly more complicated. So, here are some points to remember and things to do before and during the provincial and federal elections so that you use your  fundamental right  to vote in a free, democratic setting and also take care of your duties. 1. Confirm that your name is on the voter’s list Just before the elections, the Election Commission makes public the  database  of the voters on its website. To check that, one can simply go and choose their province, districts, (rural) municipalities, wards and respective voting centres. Once done, submit and go to the initial letter of your name to check your name on the list. If you have registered as a voter but are not sure where your name has been listed, tally the options with your voter’s card and find the right voting centre before you stand in line for the provincial and federal elections. 2. Get inked Once you reach your respective voting centre for provincial and federal elections, there will be people to help you tally your name on the list and guide you through the process. You will have to go through a few steps before you can cast your vote and, in each step, you will have to show your voter’s identity card. There will be a few representatives who will tally your name on the list and after that is done, you will have to get inked. A representative will apply ink on the thumb of the left hand so that it falls between the nail and the flesh. This is proof that you are eligible to vote and have participated in the process. Without getting inked, you will not be allowed to enter the voting booth. 3. Cast your vote  For the provincial and federal elections this time, you will have four ballot papers to cast your votes on and choose your desired representatives at the federal and provincial levels. The four steps you need to follow are divided into two parts: A federal parliament consists of a total of 334 members in the House of Representatives (HoR) and the National Assembly (NA). Out of the 334, the HoR has 275 members and the NA has 59 members. You need to understand that the House of Representatives is the only directly-elected federal assembly, and the November 20 federal elections mean the elections of the House of Representatives. In the first of four steps, the voters will choose 165 representatives, one from each of the electoral constituencies demarcated by the commission based on population and geographic convenience and speciality. The elected members have a term of office of five years. In this part of the voting process, you will continue voting for the House of Representatives, but this time, you will vote under the proportional representation election system. In this system, the entire country is considered a single constituency, and you will have to vote for your favourite political party (not the candidate). 2. Provincial elections Nepal has been divided into seven provinces, and each province has its own legislative body, called the Provincial Assembly. The sizes of provincial assemblies are different from province to province based on the population of the concerned province, but, in total, there will be 550 members elected.  Similar to the House of Representatives, the elected members have a term of office of five years, elected through two election systems as in the House of Representatives.  Through direct representation, the voters will elect 330 members, which is double the number of members elected to the House of Representatives through the first-past-the-post (direct) elections. It makes up 60 per cent of the total number of members.  This second ballot paper, the fourth overall, is for proportional representation elections of the provincial assembly. As in the case of the House of Representatives, under the proportional representation election system for your provincial assembly too, you will vote for a party and not the candidate.

How Nepal’s parliamentary elections are different from local ones? 3 key points everyone should know,"It is the eve of the parliamentary elections in Nepal, and you must be preparing to  cast your ballots tomorrow . In the meantime, you must be remembering the  previous elections held just six months ago  and some of you might be wondering why another round of elections is taking place again. If you are thinking so, you must read this piece–for here we are replacing the key differences between the local elections held then and the parliamentary elections being held now.  1. What are you voting for? The  constitution of Nepal, 2015 , introduced federalism in Nepal. With that, it has envisioned and implemented three tiers of government, with their own executive, legislative and judicial components. Executive and legislative bodies change every five years at all levels in normal circumstances. For that, under a democratic system, the people of the country cast their votes for the political parties and leaders.  In the local elections held on May 13, 2022, you voted for the candidates that would represent you in the local governments such as metropolitan cities, (rural) municipalities and wards. However, on November 20, Nepal is hosting parliamentary elections, also known as general elections, and you are voting for the candidates that would best represent you in the (federal) House of Representatives and provincial assemblies.  In fact, the parliamentary elections to be held tomorrow have two different elections: the first for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the bicameral federal parliament, and the second for the Provincial Assembly, the unicameral provincial legislature. That is why people also refer to this round of elections as federal and provincial elections, House (of Representatives) elections or provincial assembly elections. In the local elections held in May, you have already elected the local  executive and legislative  at the same time whereas the deputy mayor/vice-chairperson of the local government is authorised to lead the judicial component. Similarly, at federal and provincial levels now, parliamentary elections will take place to elect legislative bodies, and the legislative bodies later elect the executives.  2. How many votes are you casting? Earlier this year, you went into the voting centres and you were given one large ballot paper. You then  cast your votes on seven columns of that one ballot paper  which determined the winners in seven categories including the mayors, deputy mayors, your ward chair and other ward members. But, this time, you will be given four ballot papers, two each for the House of Representatives and the Provincial Assembly respectively. On each of the ballot papers, you will have to cast just  , meaning, you will cast four votes in total but on different ballot papers.  Also, you will be given the ballot papers, one after another. This means when you are done with one ballot paper, and drop it into the ballot box, you will be given another ballot paper by the representatives present there.  here here 3. What are the jobs of the elected officials? There lies the biggest difference between parliamentary elections and local ones.  The role of a lawmaker or a member of the parliament (House of Representatives or lower house) is to make policies and laws to govern the country. Likewise, the role of the provincial assembly members (also called provincial lawmakers) is to make provincial laws, rules and strategies for the provinces. The constitution clearly states the role of both federal and provincial lawmakers is to draft bills, policies and long-term plans. They are also tasked with discussing bills and making them comprehensive before they are passed, bringing new bills themselves and raising issues plaguing the country.  Another role of the lawmaker is to draft the country’s (and the province’s) budget including that for physical infrastructure development and discuss, and dissect the intricate aspects of the sector and formulate new plans and policies that benefit the citizens and the country alike.  But, the elected officials at the local level (the winners of local elections) are more focused on local development including infrastructural development. Although they also need to make rules to govern the local units, core development activities remain at the centre of their jobs. Hence, you should understand that although  candidates for the parliamentary elections have promised  you physical development in your constituency, implementing them is not their job. In fact, they have bigger issues to handle. Instead, you can expect those things from your local officials.",political
How are political student unions working for the Nepal elections 2022?,"In the history of Nepali politics, university students have played an important role in the country’s revolution. There is a long history of student unions’ involvement in politics in Nepal, which dates back to 1960. In various stages, while fighting for democracy, the students stood as the powerful medium to revolt for change. It is evident that with the help of the students, the political parties were able to propagate their values and their future programmes. Since then, student leaders and organisations (student unions) have been a part of every political movement led by parties allied to them.  So, in the  general elections this weekend , are the student leaders associated with various political parties working for elections or simply paving their own path for the future in politics? Student leaders and unions in election Currently, almost all government colleges have units of student unions supporting various political parties. While their roles in academic institutions are often criticised as they are frequently seen demonstrating and protesting in colleges and vandalising property, they become more active during political campaigns of their mother parties. It is hence apparent that the student unions have a significant role to play in the run-up to the elections.  Sunita Baral, the chairperson of All Nepal National Free Students Union (ANNFSU), the student wing of the CPN-UML, says that the students associated with her union are preparing to make the elections free and fair. As such, the union has deployed their students in all the voting booths to play a supporting role in making security strong.  The ANNFSU has formed an election mobilisation committee of 11,111 members. “Likewise, in coordination with local governments and the  Election Commission , we also conducted a voter education programme in different parts of the country,” she says.   Dujang Sherpa, the president of the Nepal Student Union, the student wing of the Nepali Congress, also agrees with Baral. He says the union’s central committee has deployed its leaders as volunteers in all 165 federal constituencies and 330 provincial constituencies. “We have also recently completed a Mechi-Mahakali tour to promote voter education,” says Sherpa.   He informs that the NSU even conducted a campaign to make people aware of their voting rights.   According to him, in rural areas, people are interested in election campaigns but they are unknown of  the voting procedure . They do not know how to vote and whom to vote for and get confused about ballot papers too, she says.   However, in urban areas, the public is well-literate about the voting procedure but is less interested in casting a vote. He says the student unions can play their roles in both situations.  Like the ANNFSU and  NSU, the  National Free Students Union (ANNFSU), the student’s wing of CPN-Unified Socialist, is also working on promoting voter education, says Ashok Thapa, the deputy secretary-general of the union.   Key players      Students and student organisations can play an instrumental role to educate people about their voting rights and help them choose the best candidates, according to union leaders.  According to Thapa, their role during the elections becomes even more essential at this moment. “In addition to urging people to vote for our candidate, we urge them to exercise their voting rights by voting for the persons of their choice.” However, experts feel that the student unions are still unaware of their significance in the elections. According to political analyst Jagat Nepal, the ideal job of a student union, particularly during the elections, is to educate people about the election and its significance.  They should have run several programmes to encourage election literacy. However, he has not found them doing so. “They are entirely busy canvassing votes for their parties and candidates close to them,” he says, “To do so is their compulsion as well. ”",political
Nepal elections in the age of social media: Here are crucial concerns,"There is no doubt about the rise of social media over recent years. Understanding the change, political parties have been using digital campaigns during the elections, and there are  some instances in Nepal also . It has proven more effective to communicate with prospective voters compared to traditional media. Facebook  is the most used social media platform in Nepal with 15.5 million active users, which represents roughly 46 per cent of Nepal’s total population. To put it in perspective, a well-targeted advertisement on Facebook has the potential to reach millions of users without much effort or money spent. However, there are some crucial concerns as using social media for election campaigns is relatively new in Nepal. While authorities find it  challenging to regulate , other stakeholders are curious about the impacts. Key challenges The  Election Commission of Nepal  has set limits for spending on digital advertising to ensure fair competition between candidates in the elections. Accordingly, a sponsored advertisement can reach 60,000 to 70,000 voters in a single day for about $100. Candidates with access to foreign currency and sufficient funds have an edge over the candidates without these means. Therefore, it is a mammoth challenge to keep track of spending on digital platforms as the country is still trying to adapt to technological transformation and the difficulties that come along with it. In order to ensure transparency, the commission needs to monitor “ghost” advertisements often used by third parties to support the candidates of their choice. In the recent Indian elections, “ghost” advertisers hid their connection to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sparked a controversy pertaining to the code of conduct and integrity of elections. Another problem with social media campaigns is the threat of misleading information and falsification. Research suggests that false news spreads five times faster than the actual narrative. Since social media platforms are virtually unregulated in comparison to traditional media, there are hurdles in censoring hate speech, smear campaigns and defaming content as well. Advertisements may sometimes be used to target potential voters of certain communities, geographical areas and specific demography of people. Cases of online harassment and misleading content are almost non-existent at present. However, The commission needs to be well-equipped in future to tackle issues as such. The future of the socials in elections The influence of social media on elections will only continue to grow in future. Hence, the nation needs to be well-prepared to keep up with the challenges of digital transformation.  Fact-checkers  and digital media analysts need to be deployed to monitor the breach of the code of conduct. While it might be entirely impossible to track everything, such an initiative could be a stepping stone towards the right direction. With candidates diverting so many resources to social media campaigns, understanding how they influence elections and what voters can do to navigate the web wisely is crucial. Barack Obama was arguably the most famous of world leaders who channelised social media on a massive scale and registered a historic victory in the 2008 US elections. A total of 55 per cent of the entire adult population on the internet at the time depended on online sources for election news, which helped him run a successful campaign. It is also important to keep pressure on political parties and candidates to maintain ethical standards for social media campaigns. It is equally vital to navigate social media wisely as an individual user.",political
Nepal elections: Why youth’s reluctance to vote is a bad idea,"As the  elections are approaching , everyone is talking about them. As a young adult about to cast votes for the first time, I and my contemporaries often come across questions such as why to vote. The reluctance to vote among the youth has become a serious problem in Nepal of late.  They say, “No, I would not vote. Why bother to stay up in a queue in the scorching sun during a holiday?” Other elusive responses such as “who would care to vote”, “everyone’s the same”, or “I choose not to vote, hence have  not acquired a voter’s id yet ” are made swiftly. Their reluctance to vote does not only depict the youth’s lack of political awareness but also hints at the likely political accident looming over the country’s democracy. The importance of voting The young population makes up over half of the voters in the country. Therein, the youth must understand that to exercise one’s right to vote is proportional to encapsulating the  very essence of democracy . Several wars have been fought, many revolutions were made just to ensure people with the right to choose their own representatives. In fact, one of the primary agendas of the early feminist movement was to ensure the enfranchisement of women. These struggles and revolutions to secure the voting right depict it as a fundamental right of a citizen. The right to vote is a political tool that allows people to have direct participation and impact on political activities within their country. Voting is fundamental as an expression of popular sovereignty and as a preservative of other rights. An election is a tool that provides us with the opportunity to exercise this right and as the youth, eligible voters we must exercise this right wisely.  The reluctance to vote is a very unwelcome message to democracy. Its impact is seriously ill.  Nepal’s case During the 2017 local elections, Dolpa’s  Mudkechula rural municipality  had a winner from the Maoist party with only two more votes than the opponent. Siddhartha Yadav of  Siraha municipalit y was able to take up the seat as the rural municipality’s head since he won by only six more votes than his opponent.  The point here is our one vote has the potential to decide what ideology takes up the seat. Our one vote has the gravity to decide as to which party’s agenda goes into the implementation. It is our vote that decides the fate of the following five years. This is to say a single person’s reluctance to vote can result in a different future than you wish for. Most of the apprehension against voting comes from the impractical and disappointing agendas in the manifesto. Nonetheless, it must be borne in mind that only when we exercise our right to vote, we get an opportunity to voice our opinion and elucidate our apprehension against the system before choosing a representative. Elections as the opportunity for political participation Despite our reluctance to vote, we also complain about the absence of youth participation in politics. But, an election is one fine opportunity to exercise political participation. Therefore, we must vote and seize the opportunity to enjoy direct political participation rather than refrain from utilising it and lamenting later. We are to remember we cannot repent about the choices we did not make. Now is the time when every citizen holds ample power in their hands by exercising the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. Rather than showing reluctance to vote, we must rather study and research to make our choices wisely. As citizens, we have a right to vote; simultaneously, the elected representatives and the state at large have a duty to implement the promises made and be accountable to their voters. We can only expect these duties to be fulfilled by exercising our reciprocal rights, not by showing our reluctance to vote.",political
Nepal elections: Get ready for a slow vote count yet again,"Do you know when the recent local elections took place? The answer is  May 13, 2022 . Do you know when the vote count in the Kathmandu metropolitan city was over and Balen Shah was declared the mayor? It was May 26 . It means the poll officials took 13 long days to count around 300,000 votes in the mayoral election. So, what are you expecting for the general elections this time?  Every election in Nepal has been followed by a sluggish vote count and the approaching elections in Nepal might not be different.  So, how long will it take? Recently, in an interview with The Kathmandu Post, Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya  said  all results of the elections will be out by December 8, which is 18 days after the voting day.  Election Commission’s assistant spokesperson Surya Prasad Aryal, however, claims that the vote counting will be completed quickly this time. “If there is no obstruction, we will complete the vote count in eight days,” Aryal says. Aryal explains the statement of CEC Thapaliya about the final election results also includes the time to divide seats among the parties in the proportional representation system and publish the names from their previously submitted closed lists.  Yet, he adds the ballot papers will be different from the local elections this time. As a result, the method of counting the ballots of roughly 18 million voters will be different, hinting the vote count will not be as smooth as the officials claim. This time, the first-past-the-post (FPTP/direct election) ballot papers will be counted in the first phase, first for the House of Representatives and then for the Provincial Assembly. The counting of votes for proportional representation elections will follow the FPTP one.  What makes the vote count slow?   Former Chief Election Commissioner Bhoj Raj Pokharel has several explanations about why the vote count in Nepal is slow.  According to him, the first issue is the complexity of the ballot paper. In the recent local elections, for example, even the parties not contesting in the local unit were also included in the ballot paper. This created confusion among the staff counting the votes.  However, Pokharel believes that the ballot papers of the parliamentary elections this time are relatively easy to count.  Second, since elections can be won or lost by a single vote, representatives of different political parties frequently confront vote-counting personnel to make sure their votes do not get counted as  invalid ones . Although the law clearly defines legitimate and invalid votes, parties only acknowledge those laws when it is convenient for them, he comments. “Every representative of political parties requests to let them inspect the ballot papers, which also creates delay,” says Pokharel.    The third reason, he says, comes into existence when some party expecting to win begins to lose the lead. Then, they disturb the count intentionally and sometimes it takes hours to settle the dispute, he says. The voting counting staff have to work day and night continuously. Their restless working pattern can sometimes accidentally make errors in the counting as well. This is also one factor for sluggish vote count, says Pokharel.   So, what are the solutions? Pokharel says the vote-counting booths should be added. Counting ballot papers from different places in the same booth also consumes more time.  “The problem of slow vote counting will not be solved unless political party representatives behave maturely and cope with the vote counting staff.”  Scientist Ram Rimal, the designer of Samyak-100, an electronic voting machine, says  the reluctance to use electronic voting machines  has made the vote count slow, and it is the only option to end the sluggish count.   The commission’s assistant spokesperson Aryal agrees. “Our political parties are unprepared for the EVM, which creates a delay in counting votes. Else, the manual vote count is certain to take its time.”",political

Before the commencement of the period, the parties and candidates should remove publicity materials.

Is Gagan Thapa becoming the Nepal PM after the elections?,"Speaking at an event held in Kathmandu on November 8, the general secretary of Nepali Congress, Gagan Thapa said apart from his party, no other party would have an election to decide who the leader of the parliamentary party becomes.  He was trying to imply that unless he gets reelected as a lawmaker, his party would also not have an election for the leader of the parliamentary party, and it would once again put Sher Bahadur Deuba as the front-runner to become the prime minister of the country. He knows no one, except him, is going to dare to challenge Deuba. And, he is right too. If you look at the major political parties, there surely will not be an election to elect the parliamentary party leader. No one is going to challenge KP Sharma Oli or Pushpa Kamal Dahal if their respective parties get a chance to lead the government after the elections. These parties are even campaigning, stating their chairpersons will become the next prime minister if they win. But, in the Nepali Congress, there are some people who want Gagan Thapa to become the prime minister. But for that, he has to challenge Sher Bahadur Deuba, the most apparent prime ministerial candidate from the party, in the parliamentary elections. But, is it possible for him to defeat Deuba and claim the PM’s hot seat? But, before that, Thapa needs to win Kathmandu 4 and beat the UML’s Rajan Bhattarai in the  elections to be held Sunday . That is why he is calling on the people to vote for him. Will he fight against Deuba? Gagan Thapa is one of the very few persons in the Nepali Congress who can challenge Deuba. Apart from Thapa, Shekhar Koirala is the only leader in Nepali Congress who can go toe to toe against Deuba. But since Thapa and Koirala are from the same faction, it is unlikely that Koirala will also give his name to be the parliamentary leader. As Thapa wants to reform the party and the country, he cannot run away from the competition in the field, he says. Hence, he believes that being elected a lawmaker and competing in the parliamentary party are the first and second steps. Thapa also believes that competing for the leadership of the party to become the prime minister is the last step that can lead the country to change. The 14th general convention of the Nepali Congress has changed party dynamics. Thapa does not have a majority within the party and with most of Deuba’s former opponents in the party, including Ram Chandra Paudel, now on Deuba’s side, Gagan Thapa has his hands full. Even if Paudel wins a parliamentary seat, people within the party say he will not oppose Deuba to become the parliamentary leader. In order to compete, there is also an obligation to have the support of a faction within the party. Paudel will never get support from the Koirala camp due to him already being close to Deuba. But, looking at things, it is clear Paudel does not want to be the parliamentary leader despite expressing his wish to become the prime minister. The same case applies to Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi and Shashanka Koirala, who were opposing Deuba before the general convention.  Hence, Gagan Thapa insists that most of the leaders mentioned above do not have the courage to compete against Deuba for the leader of the parliamentary party. “Anyone who’s won the election has the right to become the leader of the parliamentary party. But no one from our party has shown the courage,” says Thapa. Will Shekhar Koirala and Bishwa Prakash Sharma support him? If Gagan Thapa is elected, he has to get Shekhar Koirala to his side. As of now, Koirala has not announced that he will contest as the leader of the parliamentary party. But, if he does, Thapa will be in a tight spot. “I see him (Shekhar) competing with Deuba to become parliamentary leader,” says Purunjan Acharya, a political analyst close to Shekhar Koirala. But, both the Congress general secretaries–Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma–are on the same page regarding competition in the parliamentary party. Sharma is openly trying to make Thapa the leader of the parliamentary party. The two have constantly spoken highly of each other during the campaigning with Sharma even saying he would love it if Thapa could be the prime minister of the country. “Even though he’s younger than me, I believe he is the right person to lead the country. He’s shown his leadership skills during his time as a lawmaker and a minister,” Sharma said speaking at an event in Jhapa. Even though Sharma has been singing Thapa’s praises, this might change after the elections, say leaders of the Nepali Congress.  Is Koirala’s and Sharma’s support enough? Only 26 people from the Shekhar Koirala’s camp have got tickets for the House of Representatives elections. It is not known how many people apart from this camp will support Gagan Thapa in his quest of becoming the parliamentary party leader. But, some leaders say that since Thapa is the future of the party along with Sharma, there are chances he might win. “Leaders no longer see Deuba as the be-all and end-all. Times have changed,” a leader says. Gagan Thapa’s camp believes it can pull votes from Krishna Sitaula’s camp as leaders like Pradip Paudel, from Sitaula’s camp, have been talking about Thapa. According to the charter of the Nepali Congress, the leader of the parliamentary party will be the prime ministerial candidate. To become the leader of the parliamentary party, a lawmaker has to win 50 per cent of the votes from the total members of the House of Representatives from that party. If there are more than two contestants and no candidate gets 50% of the votes, there will be a second-round voting between the two candidates who get the most votes in the first round. What plans does he have? Gagan Thapa’s work and statements over the past few years have shown how he has paved the way to get ready for the post of prime minister. He has been working with a team of 60 experts and studying different fields. The team has studied what sector of the government needs policy and structural reforms. It is also studying what improvements and development should be done immediately or can be done in five years. “If someone forms a government without planning, it will fail. Like a person can easily reach the base of a mountain but if the person doesn’t have a plan on how to climb, they will fail at the first hurdle,” says Pratap Paudel, a member of Gagan Thapa’s team. “People are happy to form a government but when it comes to working, we’ve not seen much.” But, Thapa believes he has a plan for the country and adds the experts he is working with are coming up with a clear blueprint for the solution. He claims that the country will be governed based on the report prepared by the expert team. Thapa has been aggressively campaigning to become the parliamentary party leader and then the prime minister. His team has even started a Facebook campaign called  Mission PM , in which people are giving reasons why Thapa should be the next prime minister, what his project government is and what voters can expect from him. But, before that, Gagan Thapa has to win the lawmakership from his constituency, Kathmandu 4.

Citizenship bill dispute: President says she used veto as the bill was against the nation,"Kathmandu, November 16 The President’s Office says President Bidya Devi Bhandari refused to enact the controversial citizenship bill in September as the bill was against the nation, and as the head of the state, she had a veto to protect the national interests. Onlinekhabar has obtained a copy of the response the president’s Office submitted to the Supreme Court via the Office of the Attorney General in response to a show-cause notice issued by the court. The letter claims the head of the state has a veto to refuse any bill not only in countries with an executive president such as the United States but also in countries with constitutional presidents such as India. Nonetheless, the letter maintains  Nepal’s constitution  is not clear about it. — The  second amendment to the Citizenship Act  was aimed at addressing concerns of the Madhesh-centric parties and the Non-resident Nepali Association. However, it was drawn into controversy citing the citizenship bill did not bar foreign women marrying Nepali men from getting citizenship easily. Self-claimed nationalist activists have expressed concerns that loose citizenship provisions in Nepal could give the dominating India to gradually push its citizens to Nepal and perpetuate its control over the small county. Consequently, President Bidya Devi Bhandari  returned the citizenship bill  to the parliament, suggesting a reconsideration, bringing herself into a conflict with the executive. Both houses, however, approved the bill  as it was and sent it to the president. Endorsing the bill to amend the Citizenship Act through both houses of the federal parliament, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota  sent the bill to the head of the state  seeking its final assent on September 5.  As per the constitution, the head of the state was required to approve the citizenship bill sent to her for the second time within 15 days of her office receiving it. However,  she did not do so by September 20 . Consequently, a case was filed at the Supreme Court, in response to which a  show-cause order was issued .",political

Looking at home from afar: Right to vote for Nepali migrants working in Malaysia,"By coincidence, the general elections in both  Nepal  and  Malaysia,  one of the biggest hosts for Nepali migrant workers, are scheduled to run one day apart from each other this weekend. Not surprisingly, in both cases, local citizens and foreign observers are paying close attention not only to the competing candidates and party manifestoes but also to the likely political shifts that will happen after the elections. How do  Nepali migrant workers  based in Malaysia, as well as their families back home, view this important event? Drawing from conversations with six Nepali migrant workers as well as some stay-behind families (parents, wives, and teenage children), this article presents a slice of some of their observations and concerns. A common concern As shown below, elections have become a regular topic among Nepali migrant workers in Malaysia with their families back home. “Most Nepali workers here (in Malaysia) follow closely the political situation back home including the elections. But, I feel frustrated because I am here and can’t do much. I can only watch the elections from afar,” a male migrant worker from the Lumbini province who has not voted for 10 years says. “When I called back home and talked to my wife and family members during the local district election campaign period, they told me that politicians came to the villages and had celebrations. Politicians slaughtered some goats (kambing) and chickens (ayam) and distributed them to the villagers,” says a male migrant worker from the Madhesh province who voted once in Nepal before coming to Malaysia for foreign employment. “The politicians ask you to call your migrant son to cast a vote. However, when your son is in trouble abroad, they do not receive his call if he calls them asking for help,” says a stay-behind parent in the Bagmati province in Nepal. The neglected citizenry Nepali migrant workers are keenly aware that they cannot afford out-of-pocket money (like airfares) as well as time to travel back to their country to cast their votes in the district, provincial and federal elections. And, unlike some other sending countries (like  Indonesia  and the  Philippines ),  neither postal voting nor voter online registration is made available  to Nepali migrant workers. Thus, although Nepali migrant workers contribute significantly to the country’s economy, about 26% of the GDP through  remittances , they are currently politically disenfranchised. “The funds that the candidates spend during the elections are actually our money (duit)! But, some of them think they are doing charity by giving it to the people this time!” a male migrant worker from Province 1 says, adding he is a registered voter but never voted. “The politicians are just like actors, and the elections are about them playing games and getting onto chairs (kursi) for positions in the government,” a male migrant worker from Province 1 says. He is also a registered voter who voted once in Nepal before coming to Malaysia in 2016. Many observers have noted that labour is a highly politicised issue in Nepal, and every political party claims to have an agenda addressing employment in the country. Nevertheless, many politicians do not address the deeper roots of underemployment and underdevelopment in the country by continuing the slogan of providing “free visa and free ticket” to prospective migrant labourers. In 2018, the  Supreme Court of Nepal  ordered the government to consider the possibility of upholding Nepali migrant workers’ rights to vote from abroad. Another positive development was the existence of a labour and employment portfolio in the shadow cabinet which consistently raises concerns about migrant workers in parliament. Nevertheless, it has not been able to work towards securing the migrant’s right to vote because of the infrastructural, technical challenges, and security concerns of the  e-voting system . In Malaysia, the Election Offences Act 1954 ( Section 25 ) states that Malaysian employers must grant their employees sufficient time to carry out their responsibility as citizens during elections. They are also not allowed to deduct their workers’ salaries or replace the time taken out during polling day with their workers’ annual leave. It would be just if a similar interpretation applies to foreign migrant workers as the Labour Act provides that all workers in Malaysia, regardless of nationality,  are equally protected . Hope for changes at home and abroad “Yeah, many times I have gone to the Nepali embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Sometimes, I went there to help my friends, and sometimes I came for my own work. Yes, the officers in the Nepal embassy try to help more by providing groceries and taking care of their citizens in bad conditions,” a male migrant worker from Province 1 says, “But, I think they cannot do much [about the Nepali migrant workers’ right to vote] because of their limited capacity. But, they try.” “Many people in Nepal are still jobless, and job opportunities are still limited. The person sitting on the chair (government position) should understand our people’s problems, create more local jobs and handle our country’s issues better,” a female Nepali migrant worker from Province 1 of the country says, “I don’t think anyone likes to be away from their families [during such crucial times] and be here in Malaysia. Seeking foreign employment has become a significant livelihood choice for many families, and more and more Nepali youth are leaving for other countries. As the guardian of their citizens located around the world, it is imperative that the Nepali government ensures there are policies and enforcement of safe migration and protection of labour rights in the destination country. It is also their obligation to work towards ensuring the democratic voting rights of their citizens including Nepali migrant workers. MIDEQ GCRF",political
"It’s time to break the barrier to Nepal’s development by electing young, dynamic leaders","Nepal is gifted by the nature, and it is also referred to as heaven. Unfortunately, Nepal is pushed towards darkness due to incompetent leaders who are playing with the country’s political, economic, social, religious and cultural sectors. Nepal seriously lacks dynamic leaders. If you have to talk about practising democracy in Nepal, Nepalis are not able to fully enjoy its fruit. Moreover, existing political parties and their leaders are incapable of leading and have many problems. For example, the political parties seem to be private business companies, and their chairmen (yes, the chair”men”) are like the CEOs. They never take their jobs, responsibilities, and accountability to work for Nepal’s common people seriously. They are always focusing on only their family members, relatives, own circles, groups and their party members to share political power and resources. These so-called leaders are the ones who enjoyed and took benefit of so call democracy creating a huge gap between ordinary people and leaders, particularly in the case of parliamentarians. And they approach and visit ordinary people only during election time and other times be deaf to the problems of common people. But, now, with the  parliamentary elections coming to the doorstep , it is time to break the barrier to the country’s development and move ahead. You can do this by electing young and dynamic leaders in the elections.     Youth for the overall development of Nepal Digits.co.uk The ongoing corruption, some constitutional flaws, unequal treaties with neighbours, poorer development planning, weak policies and their weak implementation, and political interference in every sector are some major problems facing the country today. Leaders are guided by other countries and serve those countries’ interests. They supply the workforce across the world but fail to create employment opportunities in the country all thanks to the incompetent, greedy and selfish political parties of Nepal.  So what can bring the change in the scenario? Of course, it has to be young, energetic and dynamic leaders. Those young  leaders with integrity  are required for bringing change in the nation and leading it towards overall development. The young generation should participate actively in politics whether they are associated with political parties or independently to solve the above-mentioned problems and to deliver the best possible services for the people to build Nepal towards positivity through the leadership of young, dynamic leaders. Breaking the political syndicate Now, it is time to break the strong political syndicate deeply rooted in Nepal. Young, updated and dynamic leaders should replace outdated leaders through ballots. On the other hand, the people also should politically be aware and seriously select the appropriate new candidates in the elections and save the value for the future and coming generations. It is time for all to think twice about  how to utilise the right to vote . We know very well about the frequently elected tested and failed leaders who made Nepal economically and politically the worst nation. This is a very important time to change our traditional political mentality to transform Nepal and revolutionise political culture as well as overall development and save the nation. If we do not realise this again, definitely, we will face a worse situation and ruin the future forever, transforming Nepal into an old-age home. We know time and tide wait for none. There is no doubt if we follow the existing political culture, we will be further pushing the nation towards darkness. So, this is our chance to change by electing young, dynamic leaders.",political

Toshima Karki candidacy controversy: Supreme Court says go ahead,"Kathmandu, November 14 The Supreme Court issued a new order on Monday,  continuing its previous interim order  urging the Election Commission to not cancel Rastriya Swatantra Party’s House of Representatives candidate Toshima Karki. It means Karki can fight the elections to  be held coming Sunday .  However, the court says the case is not completely settled yet, and the next hearing will take place to seek answers about the legal complexities involved in the case. Earlier, the commission had cancelled her candidacy from Lalitpur 3 claiming she was found to be a member of the Nepal Medical Council, which can be deemed as a position with state benefits. However, Karki filed a petition at the apex court. In response to that, the court issued an interim order to not implement the decision. The commission, then, had filed an appeal seeking the interim order to be vacated.",political
"With voting 6 days away, several disputes about past election results are still gathering dust at the apex court","During the 2017 elections, Nepali Congress leader Bijay Kumar  Gachhadar defeated CPN-UML candidate  Bhagawati Chaudhary by 321 votes. But, the election results were disputed after Chaudhary filed a case at the  Supreme Court .  Prior to the announcement of the election results, Chaudhary had  filed a written complaint  at the  Election Commission  stating that Gachhadar tried to rig the elections in his favour. Her concerns were not addressed, after which she filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court stating the elections in her constituency should be considered void. But, the petition is still sub-judice at the apex court. Five years on, the two are once again competing against each other in the elections due to be held  coming Sunday . In the same year, the CPN-Maoist Centre’s Asha Koirala defeated Nepali Congress’ Pradeep Paudel by five votes in the Provincial Assembly elections for Tanahun 2(1). As soon as the election results were out, there was controversy as it was reported in one voting centre that 2,328 votes were dropped. But then, while counting, they found 2,370 votes. Poudel complained to the commission, but his efforts went in vain, after which he knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court. The case is still sub-judice like the earlier case. A total of 15 similar cases related to the previous House of Representatives and Provincial Assembly election results reached the Supreme Court. Some went to the court stating the opposition captured booths while some claimed the election was rigged. Complaints were also made regarding errors in the polling, the polling officer not destroying voided ballot paper, and the election officers not following laws during the vote counting. Candidates, both directly elected and through the proportional representation system, filed these complaints. But five years on, many of them are awaiting verdicts. Many have concluded they will not get it anytime soon. And, with the elections less than a week away, this is raising questions regarding the judiciary and its inability to give out case verdicts on time. Justice delayed Former Supreme Court justice Balaram KC says that the issue of speedy delivery of justice regarding disputes about the election results is in the roles of the judiciary. “Justice is more than being independent; it should also be fast and accessible,” says KC. “Dispensing justice is one of the characteristics of an independent judiciary. Disputes related to election results affecting the state should have been resolved as soon as possible.” Only five out of the 15 cases have been concluded. All five of the cases were of minor importance in nature. But, the Supreme Court has delayed the verdict process involving influential candidates and matters related to violation of serious laws. Senior advocate Shree Hari Aryal says that there is a history of late resolution in cases related to election results in Nepal. “This kind of problem has been common in the election dispute. Moreover, when  Cholendra Shamsher Rana  became the chief justice, it was natural that he would not try to settle cases that would trouble influential politicians,” says Aryal. “If this had been his priority, it would have been solved. Haven’t other cases been resolved?” Proportional representational candidates also filed cases at the Supreme Court complaining they were unfairly treated for various reasons. The proportional candidates approached the Supreme Court for legal remedies with complaints that they were not selected, people with lower priority than them were elected, and they were discriminated against during the selection of names. The Supreme Court did not resolve even those disputes during this period. Selective justice It is not that the Supreme Court has not concluded cases related to disputes over election results. It seems the court has settled the disputes when it knows that the petitioner has no chance to win or the case does not have strong arguments. Ram Singh Yadav, the candidate of the Maoist Centre in Dhanusha-3, also filed a case at the Supreme Court. He had mentioned two television channels as the defendants. He claimed that he lost the election after the TV channels mentioned that the chair of Rastriya Janata Party, Rajendra Mahato, supported someone else in the election and demanded re-election. But, claiming that his demands were unreasonable, the Supreme Court dismissed the case. “There is no factual basis for the plaintiff getting fewer votes based on news that was aired during the silence period,” says the court’s verdict. The Supreme Court easily rejected the claim of the candidate who did not get even 10 per cent of the votes compared to the elected candidate. A breach of the constitution According to  Nepal’s constitution , only the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court should resolve disputes about election results at the provincial and federal levels. Based on that, the disputes related to the election results were submitted to the constitutional bench. It is shocking that these petitions submitted around December 2017 have still not been resolved to date. Supreme Court officials do not want to comment on the delay in concluding the election disputes. Informally, one tells Onlinekhabar the hearing could not be held on time due to various reasons. One reason they give is the Covid pandemic that continued for two years. Another reason they cite is the suspension of Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana following the registration of an  impeachment motion against him . But, during this time, the constitutional bench was doing its job as far as other disputes were concerned. The court did nothing in 2018 and 2019 about disputes over the election results. Elections are the basic foundations of democracy. The theory that the constitutional bench within the Supreme Court of the country should resolve the dispute related to election results has now become a joke. According to senior advocate Aryal, if the election result disputes, considered sensitive, are not resolved on time, the message is conveyed to the people that the constitutional bodies are helpless. Aryal says the Parliament is the place where the representatives exercise their sovereignty by taking the votes of the people. If there is a dispute about who will represent the people, it should be resolved immediately. “These disputes should be resolved in six to eight months or a maximum of a year,” says Aryal. ” It’s embarrassing right now because these candidates who feel cheated have nowhere to go.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Education in Nepal elections: Old promises retold fail to win stakeholders’ trust,"Nepal’s constitution  says education is a fundamental right. It states that basic education is the right of every individual and the state should provide primary and secondary education free of cost. It is a harsh fact that things mentioned in the constitution have not been implemented as acts and laws have not been made on time by these politicians. But, even after years of being unsuccessful, they are still promising the same old thing to the people of the country they would do the things they failed to do up to now. Consequently, they have failed to win the stakeholders’ trust. Take major political parties’ manifestoes for the parliamentary elections as an example of this.  Nepali Congress For the next five years, as per  its manifesto , the Nepali Congress has set a target of institutionalising measurement of the learning crisis, increasing female (19-24 years) literacy rate to 95 per cent, increasing academic institutions with access to internet service to 80 per cent, increasing enrollment rate in class 11 to least 50 per cent, and technical and vocational skills in the curriculum to 40 per cent. In addition to that, it also says it wants to free the education sector from political interference by adding proper provisions to Federal Education Act. Similarly, it is mentioned that a special package will be arranged to attract talented graduates of the universities to become school teachers, and a loan programme will be put into practice for the students studying at higher levels with reasonable interest based on future income and inflation. The part that is ambitious is the party is it wants to make arrangements to remove the provision of the prime minister being the chancellor and the education minister as pro-chancellor and to establish universities as autonomous academic institutions. This is weird as the  Nepali Congress’ student wing has been involved in padlocking the university doors  for the past year.  UML: Serial liers The CPN-UML, in  its manifesto , has said to implement the policy of a fully literate country and entrepreneurial and educated youth. The UML also aims to make the country fully literate and set up at least two technical schools in each municipality. The party has also pledged to end the scenario where students are forced to pursue higher studies abroad. Then, to implement the policy of quality education for all and to standardise the schools, colleges, and institutions, it wants to introduce a provision that the government funds them. Additionally, it pledges to stop people from quitting school for financial reasons and put an emphasis on early childhood development. Furthermore, it is said that free secondary education will be provided. Likewise, the manifesto also mentions that the party wants to make the teaching profession dignified and wants to end the situation of having to do more jobs to earn extra income. It says under the UML leadership, teachers will be provided with salary facilities that enable them to live a dignified life. Apart from that, it also promises to arrange special facilities and education for students with disabilities. Along with this, the UML has expressed its commitment to making physical structures at academic institutions disabled-friendly. But, it does not answer what stopped the UML from implementing these programmes during the last three and a half years in power. Maoists: No programmes, just vote In its  election manifesto , the Maoist Centre mentions that the Federal Education Act will be issued within six months of the formation of the new government and that it will facilitate the creation of provincial and local-level laws to govern the sector. Apart from this, it mentions ensuring the right of citizens to get an education by implementing laws and regulations. It also wants to make education useful for life, science and technology and profession by reviewing the curriculum of schools, technical schools and higher education institutions. Similarly, the Maoists have mentioned that education up to class 12 will be made free and compulsory, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education will be made compulsory from the secondary level.  They say they want to make education research-oriented and minimise the gap in the quality of learning at government and private schools.  In the same way, distortion, inconsistency and corruption in the sector will be eradicated and the appointment of university officers and employees will be done on a merit basis. But, it is sad that it is planning to make over 100,000 teachers permanent, which risks the sector being heavily policitised. Unified Socialist and Janata Samajbadi: Too small to dream big The  CPN-Unified Socialist, claiming  to emerge as the fourth political force in the upcoming elections, has concluded that the standard of learning at public schools has declined and has expressed its commitment to improving it. It said that in order to implement the fundamental right to education provided by the constitution, 20 per cent of the total budget should be invested in the sector at all levels and that the federal government should invest in secondary education until the state and local governments are fully resourced. It also mentions providing free education up to the high-secondary level and puts emphasis on technical education to produce skilled human resources. Likewise, the  Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal  has said that a high-level National Education Commission should be formed to design and develop the education system in accordance with the federal framework of the country and implement practical, modern and scientific education by ending the current privatisation and commercialisation of the sector. Like others, it also said it will make education up to class 12 completely free and conduct a national literacy campaign. Like the Nepali Congress, it also wants the system of university chancellors, vice-chancellors as prime ministers and education ministers abolished and academics and capable experts appointed. Trust deficit The parties have included things in the manifestoes that have already been arranged by the constitution. Some of the promises were copied and pasted from earlier manifestoes.  The announcements of making the country fully literate, making the Federal Education Act, making sure 20 per cent of the budget in the education sector and delivering textbooks to students before the start of the academic session were mentioned in the election manifestoes during the 2017 elections also. “There is no certainty that these parties will fulfil the promises they made and they didn’t fulfil them five years ago,” says former Education Secretary Gopinath Mainali. Teacher Tirtharam Gurung is not confident that the things mentioned in the manifestoes of the parties will be implemented. He questions, “They made the manifestoes by adding some level of imagination to the provision made by the constitution. How will they be implemented?” Gurung says all the parties need to do is implement things written in the constitution and stop giving false hope to people. “I’m sure we would see positive changes,” says Gurung. Kamala Tuladhar, the president of the Nepal Teachers’ Federation, says that there is no basis to trust the manifestoes of political parties as teachers do not believe these things can be implemented. Higher Education Commission 2019 suggested that the universities should be run through the boards of trustees by removing the system of political officials as the chancellor and vice-chancellor to free them from political interference. Educationists have been preaching this for years. The Nepali Congress has added this to its manifesto, but it has also been hiring a lot of its cadres to different universities, claims Professor Bal Chandra Luitel. “The announcement of the Congress is a welcome thing. We have been saying this for a while, but after it came to power, it appointed its own people to various universities. How can you believe that it will be done according to the manifesto,” he questions. Although everyone thinks that education is necessary for economic and social transformation, the interests of political parties have been different in terms of implementing/making the programmes accordingly.  Educationist Bidya Nath Koirala also says that the manifestos of political parties are based on imagination. “An example of how the manifesto is based on fantasy is the declaration of having one Dalit teacher in every school. How will this happen? Don’t they have to pass the Teachers Service Commission exam,” he questions. Suprabhat Bhandari, the president of Guardian’s Federation Nepal, says he has no confidence that political parties’ manifestos will be implemented.  “Manifesto is good. The problem is with its implementations,” says Bhandari. Parties’ responses Krishna Paudel, the former secretary of the education department of the Nepali Congress and a member of the manifesto draft committee, claims the party has been raising issues in the field of education in every election according to the time and need. Guru Baral, the head of the education department of the UML, says that since political parties have to implement the rights provided in the constitution, they are committed to implementing them. “It is our duty to implement this,” he says. Manhari Timsina, a member of the manifesto preparation committee of the Maoist Centre, says that although the points of the previous elections seem to be repeated, they are connected with new topics when it comes to developing education. He says that although the joint manifesto with the UML in 2017 had talked about introducing the Federal Education Act, it could not be brought up due to various reasons.  “We will pass the act as soon as possible through the Parliament and implement it effectively. We believe 80 per cent of problems will be solved after this,” says Timsina.  Past deeds But, there is a reason why stakeholders are not believing in the retold promises. In the House of Representatives and Provincial Assembly elections of 2017, the  Nepali Congress promised  to establish a South Asia-level university in all provinces to provide quality education within the country, and to achieve 100 per cent literacy in the age group of 15 to 24 years within five years. The  UML and Maoist Centre promised in 2017  they would implement a revised education policy within two years, and make all students and citizens literate in five years. But, according to the data of the Human Resource Development Centre under the Ministry of Education, the literacy rate of people above 15 years is only 58 per cent, while more than 180 municipalities have not been declared literate. If the past commitment of the political parties had been implemented, about 80 per cent of the schools would have had internet facilities and all students would have textbooks. But, sadly, according to government data, only 28 per cent of schools have access to internet facilities while some children have not been able to get complete books. The Maoists had announced that they would spend 20 per cent of the total budget on education. They are repeating the same this time. Too big to execute Then, some of these promises are too big to execute. The dean of the School of Education of Kathmandu University, Bal Chandra Luitel,  says the reason why these are not being implemented is no one holds political parties accountable. “Our political parties are trying to take the king’s place. The king was not accountable to anyone,” says Luitel. Professor Suresh Raj Sharma says the country does not have the mechanism to implement the promises made by political parties.  Guru Baral of the UML denies that the issues raised by the UML in its manifesto cannot be implemented.  “Our promises can be implemented and have been in the past. Tell me how many technical schools were there before the KP Sharma Oli government and how many are there now. Things will be clear,” says Baral. Likewise, Krishna Paudel of the Nepali Congress says, “Our manifesto is prepared after discussions with teachers, professors, students, and academics. We will make every effort to implement it.” But, Professor Sharma says there is no framework for implementing the manifestoes.  “According to the current constitution, the local units should be strengthened, but we have neither created a structure nor a model on how to strengthen the local level. We had a dream but did not make a way to implement it.” This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Nepali politics in the post-truth era: Why are the effective lasting longer?,"Oxford Dictionary defines ‘post-truth’  (adjective) as ‘relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief’. It declared ‘post-truth’ as the word of the year in 2016 due to the frequency of its use in diverse debates. Now, it has arrived in Nepali politics too. This phrase got its impetus after  Donald Trump’s election  as the president of the United States and after  Brexit in the United Kingdom  in 2016. The majority of people across the world responded to these events as something unexpectedly caused by the emotional response of the people at the cost of their rationale. The word ‘post-truth’ was used earlier by different writers in different contexts. But after the mentioned events, it has been used more in the context of politics, and now misleading politics against people is associated with ‘post-truth’ politics. Observing political events around the  election times now , it seems Nepali politics is already in the post-truth phase and it is likely to continue for the next several years. Post-truth in the age of IT Communication technologies have penetrated into people’s lives in such a way that they are not only killing their rationality but deviating from their perspectives. The socio-political life of post-modern times has been highly affected by the post-truth world situation, where real truth is less instrumental and different versions of truth have significant effects on different socio-political occasions.  Post-truth is also used synonymously as a ‘customised lie’ that is executed to influence public opinion by striking their emotionality and belief systems rather than rationality and stark reality. In this sense, at present, people wishing to influence others should be smart enough to create a discourse, which could easily satisfy and manipulate people by letting them accept the things before them without any counter-question as such. Now, the question is being raised— has the rationality of humanity been suspended, and have emotion and personal belief systems been prevailing despite the fact that truth has so much evidence and valid things to project? What will happen to the entire world when post-truth starts ruling the age?  The so-called social media platforms are supposed to be significantly responsible to establish a post-truth world situation by  publicising the deluge of distorted images, fake news, propagandist ideologies, and other information . Social media platforms as communication techniques and technologies have an intense effect to shape public consciousness, more particularly during the elections. Take an example from the Nepali politics itself. Post-truth and Nepali politics The fervour of the general election has now gripped Nepali politics in a full-fledged manner. Diverse social media networks have been exploited to manipulate the common people. The intense instrumentalisation of social media technologies for propaganda and manipulation has posed critical questions about the real truth.  Different rhetorics, which have already turned out to be a fiasco, are being used by major political parties to brainwash the public. They are committed to changing the voting behaviours of the masses through the rhetoric of nationalism, employment generation, maintaining distance with India and China, taking back the Nepali territories occupied by India so far, and a host of others.  Some candidates have gone to the extent of assuring the voters to send them to foreign employment free of cost if they cast votes in favour of their parties. The most horrible scenario seen in Nepali politics, these days, is that even the so-called intellectuals holding high profiles in different sectors are the supporters of the leaders of such political parties, the ideologies of which have already been outdated, and are even seen in rallying cries during different occasions of the parties. What can we expect from them for whom the truth is not exactly what it is but what they believe and have faith in? Post-truth effects on Nepali politics The post-truth effects in Nepali politics have led it to be a pathological politics. Consequently, there is a growing disenchantment of genuine ones towards politics. This effect has merely strengthened frustration among the rational people in the country. The whole country has been the victim of disinformation, manipulation and propaganda of the major political parties for the last three decades, which are not even tried to claim that they are doing things for “loktantra” (democracy) even today.  Are we, Nepali, really slavish to these people active in Nepali politics? Are we not aware of the fact that they are absolutely coming up with false promises and tall claims to manipulate us? Despite knowing the truth, we are under the influence of politicians and fall into the trap of their emotional blackmail. Emotional blackmailing has prevented us from being sceptical about our leaders and hence, they succeeded to brainwash us time and time again.  However, we have to pay much for the momentary blissfulness of falsehood after some time. An ample example is that of Nepal, where people are still struggling to uplift their socio-economic status even after the restoration of democracy and the successful conclusion of different political movements. In fact, the post-truth world may invite a host of scary situations— political instability, social unrest, confrontation among the members of the public, security threats to the particular country, interference of external forces to the country, and failure of the nations, to name a few.  On top of that, in the name of freedom of expression, it will also lead to anarchism, which in a long run, maybe a great threat to democracy itself. The post-truth situation in Nepali politics, therefore, needs critical scrutiny by the concerned ones to save democracy from its potential threats.",political
No Not Again: Supreme Court says it’s an example of freedom of expression,"Kathmandu, November 11 The  Supreme Court  says the ongoing campaign–No Not Again–is an example of freedom of expression, ordering the Election Commission to not take any action against the campaigners in the run-up to the November 20 elections. Whereas the court issued an  interim order on November 6 , it continued the order after another round of hearing on Thursday.  Earlier, the commission had asked the operators of the group to shut it down claiming it violated the  election code of conduct  as it defamed some election candidates prior to the elections. The commission had even written to Nepal Police’s cyber bureau to take action again the group for their campaign through the Electronics Transaction Act. But, senior advocate Dinesh Tripathi and advocate Anil Acharya had filed a writ petition against the decision at the apex court. “Campaigns such as No Not Again are an example of freedom of thought and expression and a significant condition for effective enfranchisement practice,” the order issued by justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Sushmalata Mathema reads.",political
Nepal elections: Know the top 10 contenders and their key opponents,"As the  date for the Nepal elections  is just some a week away, people are excited about the polls and their results. Most of them have eyes on top leaders of major political parties and their possibly closest opponents.  In this regard, Onlinekhabar has brought details about the chiefs of 10 political parties and their potential closest rivals during the Nepal elections last year.   1. KP Sharma Oli vs Khagendra Adhikari  CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the chief of the biggest political party in the outgoing parliament, and Adhikari of the Nepali Congress are vying with each other for the second time in the federal Nepal elections (for the House of Representatives seat) from Jhapa 5. In 2017, Oli secured a landslide victory with 57,139 votes while Adhikari was restricted to 28, 297.  2. Sher Bahadur Deuba vs Karna Bahadur Malla Prime Minister Deuba, the Nepali Congress president, is contesting this time of Nepal elections with his former cadre, Karna Bahadur Malla, in the sole constituency of Dadeldhura.  Deuba has never lost the elections  so far whereas Malla also won the Provincial Assembly elections in 2017, but on behalf of Deuba’s Nepali Congress party. Malla was  expelled from the party in April  this year after he was found leading the rebellion against the party’s official candidates for the local elections. Then, he joined the Nepali Congress (BP), a splinter of the grand old party.  Representing the same party, Malla is contesting against his former boss Deuba during the Nepal elections this time. The main opposition party CPN-UML has assured him of its support.  3. Pushpa Kamal Dahal vs Abdus Miya CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal is contesting the Nepal elections from Gorkha 2 this time although he was elected from Chitwan 3 last time. The 66-year-old Dahal is vying against 29-year-old candidate Abdus Salam Miya of the CPN-UML. Dahal and Miya both are new candidates for Gorkha 2. Previously, Baburam Bhattarai used to contest from Gorkha 2 and won the election. This time, Bhattarai has extended his support to Dahal.  4. Madhav Kumar Nepal vs Ajay Kumar Gupta  CPN-Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal will be vying against Ajay Kumar Gupta of the CPN-UML to win the House of Representatives seat in Rautahat 1. While Nepal contested the Nepal elections in 2017 from the capital, he has returned to his home district this time as his newly established party is stronger in Rautahat than in Kathmandu.       5. Upendra Yadav vs CK Raut  For the upcoming Nepal elections, Yadav has formed a coalition with the CPN-UML in Saptari 2.  In 2017, Yadav won the election from the same constituency by receiving 21,620 votes, defeating Umesh Yadav of the Maoist Centre, who secured 11,780 votes. At that time, Yadav’s Federal Socialist Forum and Rastriya Janata Party had an alliance. But, this time, both parties are running against each other. Besides, he is challenged by Raut, who is  trying to establish his stronghold in the region  after leaving the secessionist agenda. 6. Mahantha Thakur vs Hari Narayan Yadav  Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Chairman Mahantha Thakur will possibly have Hari Narayan Yadav of Janata Samajbadi Party as his nearest contender. Both of them will be contesting from Mahottari 3. In 2017 also, Thakur contested from Mahottari 3 and defeated his closest contender Bijaya Chaudhary of the CPN-UML by a margin of 18,328 votes. In this election, Thakur is getting support from the Nepali Congress.  7. Rajendra Lingden vs Krishna Sitaula  Rastriya Prajatantra Party Chairman Lingden and Sitaula of the Nepali Congress are also contesting with each other for the second time, in Jhapa 3. In 2017, Lingden formed a coalition with the CPN-UML and defeated Sitaula by around 13,000 votes. This time also, the CPN-UML is supporting Lingden, but the Maoist Centre, which was on the UML side last time, is supporting Sitaula.  8. Rabi Lamichhane vs Krishna Bhakta Pokharel   Journalist-turned-politician Rabi Lamichhane , the chief of Rastriya Swatantra Party, is contesting the Nepal elections from Chitwan 2 against outgoing lawmaker Krishna Bhakta Pokharel of the CPN-UML. Lamichhane is contesting the elections for the first time while Pokharel is the winner of the past two elections from the same constituency.  9. Kamal Thapa vs Maha Laxmi Updhayaya  Rastriya Prajatantra Part-Nepal Chairman Kamal Thapa is contesting the Nepal elections from Makawanpur 1, using the CPN-UML’s nomination. Thapa was defeated in the same constituency in 2017 although he was supported by the Nepali Congress. Krishna Prasad Dahal of the CPN-UML secured 40,361 votes to defeat him. But, this time, he is fighting against the Nepali Congress with UML support.  10. Chitra Bahadur KC vs Surya Prasad Pathak   Chitra Bahadur KC, the chairman of Rastriya Janamorcha, is contesting against Surya Prasad Pathak of the CPN-UML from Baglung 1. In the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections, KC was elected from Baglung 2. KC was support from the ruling alliance to fight against Pathak, who was elected from the same constituency in 2017.",political

"Election Commission: Decide in haste, revoke at leisure is the golden rule before elections","The  Election Commission , on Saturday, wrote a letter to Setopati, a Nepali online news portal, ordering it to remove a news article written by the website  about CPN-UML leader Agni Kharel’s son . The commission, in the letter, stated the news website was writing to defame the electoral candidate which went against the  code of conduct for the November 20 elections . This caused an uproar with people from all walks of life criticising the commission. Following that, the commission took a step back and decided to withdraw its decision and called it a technical error and tried to save itself. On October 20, the commission asked CPN-Unified Socialists leader Madhav Kumar Nepal for clarification on why he was financially alluring voters claiming to give free visas to migrant workers. The commission was even planning to  send a letter to the District Police Office , Rautahat, asking it to take action against Nepal for violating the code of conduct. But, the commission did not do so. “We had readied everything, but the letter wasn’t sent,” says a source from the Election Commission. “We don’t know if the letter will be sent or not. If the letter is sent, the details are likely to be changed.” Even though the police were given the right to arrest Nepal, the message was sent out too late.  On October 25, the commission ordered youth operating a Facebook group, No Not Again, to shut it down. The group was spreading a message about not voting for old leaders who had failed the country.  Once again, the decision sparked outrage as people claimed it went against the freedom of speech, after which the commission withdrew its decision yet again. The commission wanted to shut down the group, but it ended up making it so popular that people from all around Nepal became a part of the group. The Supreme Court also  issued an interim order  on the writ petition filed by senior advocate Dinesh Tripathi asking the commission to take no action against the group. After that, the commission’s statement changed. “You can say no not again or elect again. But, please say it in a decent way that is all we care about,” said Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapalia at an event on Sunday. These examples show how the Election Commission is working before the elections. It has been taking decisions in haste not thinking about what their effects will be in the public eye. The officials do not even think if the decisions it takes will be implemented. As a result of that, it has been regularly taking back decisions it has made in recent weeks. Tied hands The code of conduct issued by the Election Commission states sitting ministers at the provincial and central levels cannot go to another constituency stating it is illegal to use state funds to promote an election campaign. After the code of conduct was released, there was a lot of criticism from all political parties including the CPN-UML. After that, the commission could not stand firm on its decision and took a step back. The code of conduct was then amended by the commission stating the ministers could go upon permission from the commission but could not use state resources. After pressure from the ruling and opposition parties, the commission could do nothing but change its decisions, say sources at the commission. When the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers sent a letter to the commission seeking permission to let Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba visit Dadeldhura, it could not take a concrete decision. Since the letter came from the Prime Minister’s Office, officials from the commission deemed it a government visit. But after asking Deuba not to use or abuse any state resource, he was given permission to go. The commission even questioned who would pay the charges for the helicopters used by the Deuba, Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal when they went to Sukhet last month. It asked government bodies to send their answers but has not got one so far. Deuba has once again used a Nepal Army helicopter to go to Dadeldhura. But, if the payment for the helicopter will be done by the government or Nepali Congress is unclear. Despite not getting clear answers from these parties, the commission continues to give them permission to do as they please. If you can’t be convinced, get confused In Setopati’s case, however, the Election Commission looked to have crossed its jurisdiction as the role of monitoring the media is given to the Press Council of Nepal. This decision was made by the commission itself. The people in the commission were confused as to why the letter was sent as there were many questions pointed out within the commission itself. A government attorney was even sent back in regard to this case.  Meanwhile, a few weeks ago at a press conference at the commission, CEC Thapaliya said that vehicles would be able to run on  voting day . But, a meeting of security agencies a week later told Thapalia that there was no way that they would be able to provide security if vehicles were allowed to run on election day. Even officials from the Home Ministry were not in favour of allowing vehicles to run. Now, the Election Commission plans on allowing vehicles in some parts of the country where there are no security threats. Even this is not sure as a final decision is yet to be made. All this has left Thapaliya redfaced as his statements were made without talking to anyone and in haste. The commission had also stated that those who contested the local elections and did not submit their expense details would not be allowed to contest the forthcoming elections. These people would only be allowed if they submitted a fine. The fine, according to the commission, could be submitted in any commission office and even on public holidays. The commission, which showed generosity for those who wanted to compete in the elections, initially arranged for fines in a very rude and harsh manner.  A few weeks ago, the commission made guidelines for submitting various documents during the nomination process. It was preparing to submit property details and make the details of the elected candidates public. The commission made it voluntary after questions were raised about such provisions being against the Right to Privacy Act. Following this, the details would only be made public if the candidates wanted to. The unorganised house According to an Election Commission source, such incidents are happening due to a lack of coordination among election commissioners. “Due to the delegation of authority, some of the work is done by some election commissioners alone, but later, they take it back after knowing it can’t be done,” says the source, adding most commissioners now do not want to talk about it, fearing criticism. Former Election Commissioner Dolakh Bahadur Gurung says that the decisions made by the Election Commission, which has the constitutional obligation to conduct free and fair elections, should be universally accepted by all. “Whatever the commission says, it should be done and implemented,” he says, “Since it will have a far-reaching impact on the fairness of the elections, restraint, patience and legal considerations should be considered while making every decision.” He suggests that even though the shortcomings made by the Election Commission so far have not caused much damage, now as the elections are nearing, the commission should be even more sensitive.

"CIAA files 124 appeals for revision to Special Court verdicts, 84 more than original lawsuits, in 4 months","Kathmandu, November 8 The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority ( CIAA ) has filed 124 appeals at the  Supreme Court  requesting it to revise  Special Court  verdicts in four months.  It is interesting that the anti-corruption constitutional body has only filed 40 original lawsuits at the Special Court in this period. Since the beginning of the fiscal year (July 17, 2022), the commission filed 124 appeals at the apex court, expressing dissatisfaction over the Special Court decisions.  In a press conference in Kathmandu on Tuesday, the CIAA spokesperson Shyam Prasad Bhandari says the constitutional body has been filing appeals for revision as some of the Special Court verdicts contradicted precedents and legal values.

"Absentee voting is essential in Nepal given the migrants’ contribution, but authorities are uninterested","Almost four years back, the Supreme Court of Nepal  ordered the government  to provide Nepalis living abroad with voting right in future elections. However, the provision of absentee voting has not been implemented yet nor is there any sign that it will come into effect anytime soon.  If the Supreme Court precedent is considered a part of the country’s law, over two million Nepalis were denied the opportunity to exercise their basic political right in  the local elections  held in May. And, this is not going to change in the  upcoming federal and provincial parliamentary elections , thanks to a lack of action from the authorities. Stakeholders say it is imperative to give migrant workers their enfranchisement given their contribution to the national economy with the remittances they send. However, the responsible authorities look confused, if not uninterested, about how Nepal can exercise absentee voting.  No progress According to a  report  from the Central Bureau of Statics published in July this year, 21,69,478 Nepali are living outside Nepal. All these people are potential voters as they have already reached the age of majority. Article 21 (3) of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  reads, “The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.” It means if Nepal continues to count its migrant workers as its own citizens, the authorities need to make immediate efforts to introduce absentee voting, says labour rights activist Aashish Rai.  Rai and his team have been frequently holding meetings with the  Election Commission  for the past seven years to put pressure on the authorities to introduce the system. “But, no progress has been made so far.” “They (the commission) say the interference of top political parties is the main reason behind the inability to introduce the external voting system,” says Rai.   Rai and his team have also collected the signatures of Nepali migrants from 17 different countries, demanding absentee voting rights and have submitted it to the commission, but in vain.   But, the commission’s assistant spokesperson Surya Prasad Aryal says there are no legal grounds to allow absentee voters to cast their ballots now.  “We have even conducted various studies for external voting and submitted the reports to the government,” says Aryal. “But, there has not been any progress since then.” The blame game Neil Kantha Uprety, a former chief election commissioner, says unless the government builds a mechanism to register absentee voters in their host countries, it is impossible to let them vote now.  But, he believes that building such a mechanism has never been the priority of the government. The government does not have a policy because political parties are not prepared for this. CPN-UML leader Binda Pandey, also an outspoken labour rights activist, blames the political leadership for the failure.  “Depriving migrants of their voting rights is against the spirit of democracy,” she says, “But, the political leaders that are in power today are old-fashioned. They do not accept and believe in the absentee voting system that comprises the use of technology.” They feel insecure with technology and unless they get rid of such a mentality, it is hard to provide voting rights to the Nepalis living abroad, she adds.    Meanwhile, Dila Sangraula, a leader of the ruling Nepali Congress, says disagreements among political parties hindered the voting rights of Nepali people living abroad.  “Our party is very positive to introduce the absentee voting system. Time and again, we have raised our voice for it as well,” says Sangraula. “The reluctance of other parties is the main obstruction for an external voting system.” Implementation complexities But, a lack of willingness is not the only problem. Technically, this is a difficult process. Migrant Nepalis can be able to vote only if voting booths are installed at the embassies. But, that can be not a complete solution yet. Pandey doubts the number of migrant workers going to the embassies might not be great all the time.  Of course, online voting might solve this issue, but Nepali authorities do not believe in technology. The most apparent example is their reluctance to introduce  the electronic voting system in Nepal .  Globally, absentee voting is not a new concept now. Both developed and developing nations have already  exercised  it. Not only Sweden, Canada, the Philippines, Spain and Italy, but developing countries such as Senegal, Brazil, Mexico, and Honduras have also been exercising external voting.   Pakistan remains the only country in South Asia that  allows  absentee voting, in which the voters can log into the National Overseas Voting System and cast their votes.",political
Climate change in Nepal elections: Why are stakeholders happy about hollow promises ?,"Despite his rush to fly to Sharm El-Sheikh of Egypt to attend the 27th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ), also known as the United Nations Climate Change Conference, Bimal Regmi, a climate change expert, managed time to go through the election manifestoes of major political parties. Regmi says he, like scores, also does not believe the parties will implement their pre-election commitments, yet he does not think the time he spent reading the manifestoes went to waste. “If not encouraging and exciting, they have given satisfactory space to climate change in the manifestoes,” Regmi told Onlinekhabar over the telephone from Sharm El-Sheikh, “In the past, you could rarely find ‘climate’ as a word in their election manifestoes as it would be mixed up with other environmental issues. But, this time, they have clearly identified the issue.” If you look back to two manifestoes issued by the three biggest parties for the parliamentary elections in 2017, climate change appears to be distant from their responsibilities. The  manifesto of the left alliance  of the CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre, which won the elections, mentioned ‘climate’ once under the title of Conserving Natural Heritage and Environment. The  Nepali Congress mentioned  Climate Change along with Environmental Conversation, but it lacked any measurable outcomes.  This time, the story is different. Climate change appears in the titles of subject matters that the  CPN-UML  and the  Nepali Congress  have listed to express their commitments. In addition, some of the goals they have set are specific and measurable. The  Maoist Centre  does not have ‘climate’ in any of the titles, yet, it has given enough space to the topic. The party has even managed to talk about the ongoing COP27 in the manifesto. Small parties have also given some space to climate change. “I don’t believe in these manifestoes as what the parties say or write does not match with what they do,” climate change activist Raju Pandit Chhetri says, “But, if you forget that, whatever the parties have written this time are not bad at all.” Other stakeholders agree with him. They are okay with the promises and now await their implementation. Big talks of big parties  The big parties have connected climate change with forest conservation, clean energy, pollution control and disaster risk management. As managing finances for climate adaptation and mitigation has been one of the major challenges for Nepal, the parties have also spent some words on addressing that concern. Without setting a time limit, the CPN-UML has vowed to prepare a strategy to increase Nepal’s forest cover to 45 per cent of the total area. It means the opposition party has endorsed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur  Deuba’s announcement during the COP26 last year  that Nepal would increase the forest cover to 45 per cent by 2030.  Apparently, for the opposition party that aspires to lead the next government post-elections, endorsing the government’s international commitment can be one of the most prudent promises it can make. But, Prime Minister Deuba’s Nepali Congress has come one step forward and vowed to increase the forest cover to 47 per cent in the next five years. Another major promise that Deuba made during the climate summit last year was achieving net zero by 2045. Whereas his party has vowed in its election manifesto to begin the road map of a green economy, ultimately reaching net zero, the UML and the Maoist Centre are silent. Among major national parties, the Nepali Congress has become the smartest one in presenting its climate promises in a clear and measurable way. Except for its 20 “guarantees”, the UML manifesto uses bulky paragraphs whereas the Maoist Centre looks uninformed of Nepa’s international obligations and promises. But, the Nepali Congress has tried to present everything in points and numbers.  For example, the UML has repeated the promotion of electric vehicles many times while it has failed to quantify this. Instead, the Nepali Congress talks little yet clearly says it wants to increase the use of electric vehicles and stoves to 50 per cent in the next five years.  “These targets are not only specific and measurable but also achievable if the political leadership is committed,” Regmi says. Likewise, Chhetri adds the overall impression of the parties in terms of net zero, electric vehicles and  climate-smart agriculture  is positive. “If they are to be implemented, they, of course, will do something good.” Disaster risk reduction and management are not missing in any of the manifestoes. The UML has included regular duties such as vulnerable area identification and mapping as well as post-disaster rescue and relief also in its manifesto.  The Nepali Congress has stressed using local construction technologies and materials to prevent floods and erosions. The Maoist Centre is focused on providing ample resources including the workforce for disaster risk reduction and management. It also talks about strengthening the  early warning systems . “Disaster should always be a priority in Nepal and the parties have understood it well,” Regmi says, “But, most of their commitments, sadly, are traditional and they do not hold the strength to transform the system.” While the Maoist Centre appears to be weak in comparison to the UML and the Nepali Congress in the overall presentation of the climate change agenda, it nonetheless has some impressive plans that other parties missed. For example, it vows to provide grants and other assistance to individuals and community groups that practise exemplary climate adaptation models at the local level. It has also talked about connecting climate financing to the local level. “It is because the public today is also aware of climate change concerns. The parties cannot win votes just by promising electricity, roads and bridges as they could in the past,” climate activist Shreya KC says, “The parties know they must address climate crisis to connect themselves to the young population.” The  CPN-Unified Socialist appears weaker  than the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre in raising climate issues in the manifesto. Nevertheless, it also talks about disaster risk reduction and management, resilience, utilisation and conservation of natural resources as well as climate adaptation at the local level. The resolutions open to ridicule But, there is not everything to be hopeful about. The parties have failed to meet stakeholders’ expectations in some crucial concerns. While stakeholders are virtually divided over the $100-million loan agreement signed between the government and the World Bank with most of the  stakeholders opposing the deal , Prime Minister Deuba’s Nepali Congress party has said it would make efforts for both concessional loans and grants for climate financing.  “It could have just said ‘finances’ instead of specifying the categories. Also, it didn’t understand that grants and loans are not the only instruments of climate funds available,” says activist Chhetri. All parties are on the same page regarding the need to make climate change and climate finance a matter of diplomacy and international lobbying. They also talk about internationalising issues regarding mountainous climate. Yet, the parties are not clear about how that can be done, says Buddhi Sagar Poudel, the chief of the Climate Change Management Division at the  Ministry of Forests and Environment . “It seems they didn’t have any clear direction about Nepal’s international agenda about loss and damage and climate compensation. It would have been better if they had discussed all these issues with the stakeholders before drafting the manifesto because the manifestoes would guide their government’s policy and programme tomorrow.” But, the parties seem quite distant from such concerns. The Maoist Centre has even dared to lay itself open to ridicule by mentioning the ongoing COP27, which would be over two days before the voting in Nepal, on its election agenda. The party has said Nepal would make efforts to develop a common strategy for mountainous countries during the COP.  It seems the party does not know that most of the Nepali delegates to the climate change conference had already left the country before it made the manifesto public. Nor did it understand that Nepal’s participation in the COP this time is just nominal, given all stakeholders’ focus on the general elections being held in the next two weeks. It is noted here that Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who himself leads the Environment Ministry after  firing Minister Pradeep Yadav  over the coalition conflicts, has sent his women’s and children’s minister, Uma Regmi, to lead the delegation. While the participation of a minister from an unrelated portfolio makes the Nepali delegation weak in Sharm El-Sheikh, she is not staying there through the conference either. “In this context, a party mentioning the pre-election COP in the election manifesto is just ridiculous,” a commentator says. Big dreams of small parties But, overall, the big parties’ commitments to addressing climate change concerns this time are positive, comments Chhetri. “It also means that other smaller parties can learn from the biggies tomorrow. If implemented, these manifestoes hence will hold long-term significance.” But, small parties have already learnt the importance of climate change in the modern world. In Regmi’s observation, Baburam Bhattarai-led  Nepal Samajbadi Party  and Rajendra Lingden-led  Rastriya Prajatantra Party  have also made encouraging promises regarding climate change. “It seems no one is weaker than their competitors when it comes to writing about climate.” Probably because climate scientist Arnico Panday led the drafting of the manifesto of Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party, climate change is a priority there too. The argument that Nepal should receive compensation from the international community for the climate crisis here, an issue that even major parties failed to raise, has received priority in the  Swatantra Party’s manifesto . Nonetheless, its promises do not look measurable. Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, still known to be a Madhesh-centric party among the general public despite it being a national party legally, nonetheless, has failed to raise climate change in  its manifesto  clearly. Will they walk the talk? It’s always easier said than done. While the parties appear confident in talking the talk, will they keep the promises?  Many people doubt.  “These manifestoes are all formality. If the elections had not coincided with the COP,” a critical Chhetri says, “I don’t think the parties would have talked about climate change with such significance in their manifestoes.” Meanwhile, Regmi believes the parties do not have clear strategies to implement their promises. “The problem is so deep that hundreds of people die every day. It’s a bitter truth that the parties couldn’t show the same level of sensitivity in them. These promises are not tangible.” Chhetri, on the other hand, thinks the parties have failed to mainstream climate change. “They have talked about reducing carbon emission while they also focus on multiplying employment opportunities on the other,” Chhetri says, “But, you need to understand that creating employment opportunities needs more factories that emit carbon. How you can reduce carbon emission, by using electricity maybe, is missing there.” But, there is no alternative to addressing climate concerns, says KC. “Whichever party can express itself more clearly about climate change and sustainable development can claim itself to be going beyond immediate petty benefits and looking forward to long-term development. The political leadership must realise this.”",political

"Nepal sees corruption scandals quite frequently. Yet, why don’t parties put them on their election agenda?","Corruption scandals are quite common in Nepal. Once the media raise them, lawmakers take them to the parliaments, make strong statements and put pressure on authorities to investigate them. Investigations are launched, but then the cases are over. If the political leadership was committed to not repeating them, they make corruption scandals involving parties against them as major reasons to solicit votes from every election. But, it rarely happens in Nepal; it seems there is a consensus among them to not talk about corruption before the elections. Currently, parties are busy with election campaigns, but no one is seriously speaking about big corruption scandals in the country. Why? Below, we will tell you more about eight corruption cases that emerged in the past five years, involving leaders of different parties, yet they fail to be discussed ahead of the next elections.  1. Wide wide-body case reaches Deuba  On December 26, 2018, standing on the rostrum of the House of Representatives, the main opposition leader at that time, Sher Bahadur Deuba, aggressively highlighted how he knew there was corruption in the  Nepal Airlines Corporation’s purchase of widebody aircraft  and that he would do everything in his power to punish those involved in the corruption scandal. “There has been corruption in this case and people should know the details. We need to find out what was done and tell people the truth. We will not let the people involved get away with it,” he said. He pointed his anger towards then prime minister KP Sharma Oli telling him how he could not keep tabs on such a major procurement that took place when his government was in power. This is probably the last time Dueba spoke with authority in the lower house. After that, the House’s Public Accounts Committee started its investigation into the potential corruption scandal. Oli also spoke answering Deuba that the procurement of the aircraft took place before his term. He even defended the procurement, which clearly took place before his time. After the Public Accounts Committee, the government too formed an investigation commission under the leadership of former justice Govindra Parajuli. But, since its members never received an official letter, no work was done. Eyebrows were raised when the commission was formed as the government already has an autonomous body, the  Commission for Investigation of Abuse Of Authority  (CIAA) to investigate such corruption scandals. But, as the commission did not do anything, it was quite evident that it was formed just as a means of distraction. Oli kept defending his tourism minister Rabindra Adhikari. But after  Adhikari’s death  in a helicopter accident, the issue was swept under the carpet as Oli did not speak a word on it and the CIAA has still not given its conclusion on the case. When the Public Accounts Committee was about to submit its report, the committee found Deuba’s involvement during the procurement. A few days after Deuba became the prime minister on June 7, 2017, he paved the way to pay for the wide-body. During that time, Deuba himself was the tourism minister. Following Deuba’s decision, Tourism Secretary Shankar Adhikari wrote to Nepal Rastra Bank asking for money for the first instalment of the aircraft. After Deuba’s name in the corruption scandal came to the surface, political pressure was used to remove his and other top leaders’ names from the committee’s report. After Deuba found he was also involved in the case, he did not speak a word about the wide-body case thereon.  “The rewards of political change in the country were reaped only by a handful of clever people. The mass never got to fully take advantage of it,” says Bhakta Kharel, assistant professor at Tribhuvan Univerity. “We have seen a lot of cases of corruption come to light during the past five years but action has not been taken. Nepal’s laws are very weak and until we change that, people will continue to get away with things.” 2. The big bosses of the Baluwatar land scam For decades, no one spoke about how the land around  Lalita Niwas  owned by the government secretly came under people’s names. After the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party came to power, a committee was formed to investigate the corruption scandal after continuous pressure from home secretary Prem Kumar Rai.  The committee was led by former secretary Sharada Prasad Trital, which came to the conclusion that the Council of Ministers had wrongfully allowed the land to be put under people’s names. As revealed by the committee, the government led by Madhav Kumar Nepal in 2009-2010 had given the land illegally to a tenant who did not even use the land prior to the government giving him some part. Since it was wrong, the Land Reform Office did not give the land to him. But the land was given to the person using the Land Revenue Office. In 2012, when Baburam Bhattarai was the prime minister, his cabinet made another controversial decision. There were not much land left and the Council of Ministers decided to transfer the land to Pashupati Tikincha Guthi. That then paved the way for the land to get into people’s hands. After that, all of Lalita Niwas’ land was under the names of different people. The CIAA investigated the corruption scandal. It called Nepal and Bhattarai and secretly recorded their statement. Others in the government service had to be called to the CIAA to give their statements, but oddly, the CIAA allowed them to give their statements from their homes. A team led by then-secretary Maheswar Neupane went to people’s homes to record their statements and came to the conclusion that no case would be filed against them. A case was filed against this decision, which is still sub judice in the Supreme Court. Both Nepal and Bhattarai have never spoken or written about their involvement in the case. Instead, they went on to state how Oli was trying to defame them.  But, on what basis did they make the decision? Was it even legal? No one has spoken about this.  3. The omnipotent Omni In March 2020, the first wave of the Covid pandemic was hitting Nepal. The government wanted to be proactive and decided to do everything in its power to ensure the country did not cripple due to Covid-19 as the west had. A high-level committee was formed under Deputy PM Ishwar Pokharel. As the lockdown was being planned, the committee also decided to  purchase health equipment  and called for tenders. But, it turned into a notorious corruption scandal later.  The procurement should have been the role of the Department of Health Services, but everything was bypassed and the high-level committee was taking all decisions. “Everything was done in haste. The minister issued a notice and a negotiation committee was formed and items were procured,” the then health secretary Yadav Koirala told the parliament’s Public Accounts Committee. Later, it was revealed that the deal with the Omni Group was a scam as everything was overpriced. Fingers were pointed at Pokharel and Health Minister Bhanu Bhakta Dhakal and other officials for their alleged involvement in the corruption scandal. But, the officials said they had to procure the medical equipment after being ordered by the high-level committee formed to combat coronavirus.  Issues were raised by the Public Procurement Monitoring Office, which is directly under the prime minister. The office said that the procurement that happened under the eyes of the minister was not lawful. Even though the ministries said the procurement happened under special circumstances, the office said it could not find sufficient documents to support the claim. Irregularities were pointed out, including that the head of the office was not responsible for the purchase, the previously opened tender was cancelled without justification, the cost estimate was prepared after asking the suppliers, it was not revealed whether Omni was eligible for the purchase of health materials, the cost was prepared in rupees and the agreement was made in dollars, and the quality of the goods was not guaranteed.  Pokharel, Dhakal and other officials from the health sector did not answer the charges of their involvement in the corruption scandal. Rather, they used their power to influence the decision of the Public Accounts Committee. The committee, without recording Pokharel’s statement, sent its report to the CIAA. Former Secretary Som Bahadur Thapa comments that the parliament after 2017 has been ineffective when it comes to public accountability. “If we only look at the events, the government agencies haven’t been able to set a standard and take issues like this seriously,” he says. 4. Baburam’s bravery (?) regarding Budhigandaki On October 8, 2020, former PM Baburam Bhattarai accused major leaders of political parties of pocketing around Rs 9 billion from the  infamous Budhigandaki Hydropower Project .  “The corruption is in billions. This is theft,” he said. “I know KP Sharma Oli, Sher Bahadur  Deuba and Prachanda (Pushpa Kamal Dahal) have pocketed the money along with others. I will prove it.” The project was started in 2012 when Bhattarai was the prime minister. After Bhattarai’s allegations, people who he had accused,  came out and protested . But, they did not state how and on what basis they were innocent and on what basis the tenders had been assigned. They  asked Bhattarai to prove his statement  instead.  Interestingly, at an event held in Nepali Congress’ party office a month ago, Bhattarai conflicted his statement. He said he did have information about the potential corruption scandal, but that information did not have substantial proof.  5. Baskota’s big pockets On February 19, 2020, an audiotape was released that shook Nepali politics. In the audio, then Communications Minister Gokul Baskota was asking for a bribe in excess of Rs 700 million with Bijaya Prakash Mishra to set a deal for the purchase of a printing press for the government. Following that,  Baskota was forced to resign .  A complaint was filed at the CIAA asking for an investigation into the corruption scandal.  The then CIAA chief Navin Kumar Ghimire tried to delay the case as long as possible, but he could not. But, the CIAA did give its final verdict, in which it stated that there was no proof that Baskota took a bribe. After that, there were even efforts to reinstate Baskota as a minister.  The Public Accounts Committee also started a probe into the corruption scandal but could not reach a conclusion. Baskota even  filed a defamation case  against Mishra for recording the phone call. Oli even supported Baskota regularly rather than asking for a clean investigation of the case.   6. Rana’s ruling Deuba’s fifth term as the prime minister has not been that great as far as corruption scandals are concerned. One of the biggest controversies his latest term has faced is making suspended Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana’s choice as a minister for helping Deuba become the prime minister through the  order to reinstate the House  dissolved by Oli. Deuba had made Gajendra Hamal, Rana’s brother-in-law, the Minister of Industries and Supplies. But, following heavy criticism,  Hamal had to resign . This was the start of Rana’s bad days. Talks started about impeaching him. But, when Rana was called to give  his statement in response to the impeachment motion  filed against him, no one from either the ruling or the opposition party queried him about him asking for a seat for his people in the cabinet.  What Deuba was accused of was huge. But, he has not spoken about it as he feels he does not need to answer questions posed to him. If you look at history, Deuba has never really addressed allegations of involvement in corruption scandals against him.  Deuba is also accused of acting according to his wife  Arzu Rana Deuba’s rules . There have been sources who say it is Arzu Rana who selects who leads the different government bodies including at the ministry level and asks Deuba to appoint them.  7. Sharma’s curious CCTV case In May, another corruption scandal did plague Nepali politics. Finance Minister Janardan Sharma was accused of letting a former ministry staffer and an outsider into the ministry during the drafting of the budget.  Annapurna Post quoted  a source stating those people came to the ministry to alter interest rates that would benefit a few people. Following that, Sharma faced criticism and  resigned . Opposition CPN-UML raised the issue and a  parliamentary investigation committee  was formed. The committee questioned Sharma, secretary Madhu Marasini and revenue secretary Krishna Hari Pushkar. Marasini  took a leave of absence  and got transferred to the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. But, the panel could  not find Sharma guilty  and he  became the finance minister again .  This corruption scandal questioned the investigation process of Nepal’s parliamentary committee. With the CCTV footage missing, there was no way they could determine where a person was during a set time. The issue is rarely talked about now as no one was put to blame for the missing CCTV footage. 8. The CM’s costly cycles The Madhesh provincial government as a part of the ‘Educate Girl, Save Girl’ campaign decided to distribute cycles to all schoolgirls. The idea was quite innovative as it aimed to put a stop to the dropout rate of girl children.  But, soon, the project came under scrutiny as the CIAA suspected that it could be a corruption scandal. Later, it registered a corruption case against a few provincial officers.  One of the main people involved in the corruption scandal was Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut. But, Raut was not booked for corruption. He did go to the CIAA and registered his statement, but following that, he did not say anything anywhere. Officials who cannot move a leaf without the permission of the chief minister had to face a corruption case of embezzling Rs 103.3 million.

Why do you need the right to reject (NOTA) in Nepal elections?,"In a democracy, it is the inherent democratic right of the people to choose their representatives. But, the government cannot be considered fully representing the people unless the people have the right to choose the right to reject/”none of the above” ( NOTA ) options. Assurance of the availability of the right to reject or NOTA in the election procedure is a must to materialise the essence of democracy and freedom, but Nepal has not been able to materialise yet. If you voted in the  local elections  last May, it is time for another one  scheduled for November 20 . And, here are the things you should know about the right to reject before you utilise your rights. Democracy and freedom of expression The powerful means of ensuring people’s participation in governance is the right to express one’s views and having the means to exercise that right. Keeping it simple, the theoretical and practical form of freedom of expression enjoyed by the people in a country is a means of examining the use of democracy. The generally accepted principle of election is that it should be fair and transparent, where every citizen should be given an opportunity to express their views.  If the channels of freedom of expression of the people are blocked or become less effective, or if freedom of expression is not exercised freely, or if it appears to be of a planned nature rather than fully manifested, there is little basis for believing that democracy is in line with its ideals. The right to reject is an integral part of freedom of thought and expression and has an interdependent relationship with the right to vote and freedom of expression. Does the right to vote include the right to reject? The simple understanding is if a process is carried out for any purpose to express one’s choice, one has the right to accept or reject it. Freedom of expression includes the right to speak as well as the right to silence. In the same way, the right to vote means that a candidate does have the right to vote or the right to reject. There is no specific law allowing the right to reject as such yet in Nepal. However, in January 2014, the Supreme Court of Nepal  passed a landmark judgment , which gives the voters the right to reject. They could cast negative votes, rejecting all the candidates if they do not want to vote for anyone.  Owing to the landmark decision, the concerned agencies were supposed to start their homework to ensure negative voting provisions in the electoral process. However, the ruling was not implemented in the elections of 2017. Five whole years after the first verdict, the Supreme Court again issued another directive order to formulate a law to allow the voters to reject candidates in the election in September 2019. But, neither the government nor the  Election Commission  seems to be working on providing citizens with the right to reject and choose NOTA. Why is the right to reject necessary? When voting in the election process, are the people compelled to cast their vote only for the candidate whom the political party trusts? What if all of the present candidates do not compel the voters to vote in favour of any of them, no matter how incompetent they may be? If the existing candidates or options are unacceptable, forcing them to accept without removing them is forcing them to choose the inferior option. Under the guise of democracy, it is not necessary to establish a system of choosing ‘least of all the least’ forever. If there is dissatisfaction with the incumbent candidates, the people cannot be considered to be represented in the government as long as the people do not have the right to reject them. Then, such a government cannot be considered to exist in the true sense as a legitimate government. If any of the existing candidates are not found to be acceptable during the voting, the voters may express their opinion in such a way as to create the best competitive conditions for the candidates and reject the existing candidates for the purpose of governing and controlling the people. Would not it be better if people do not participate in the voting process? The non-participation of people in the election for a reason—they do not like the candidates—does not portray a healthy sign of democracy. Elections without the participation of the people or without the real will of the people cannot lead to the development of a good democratic culture.  A resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly calls on all nations to participate in the decision-making process for the institutional development and consolidation of democracy. Therefore, in addition to the many practical difficulties, the justification for giving the voter a place to express his or her dissent to vote for any of the candidates (right to reject) is necessary to respect the inherent right of the people to seek the option they have chosen from the heart and reject other options given. Citizens have the right to select the candidate nominated by the political party and also the right to reject them. Giving space is necessary and appropriate for a democratic election. In order to protect the right to secrecy of the citizen regarding the issue of non-voting, it will be necessary to make provision for the right to reject (NOTA) in the ballot paper in order to prevent the situation of not going to the polls for not liking the candidates. Is voting a right or duty? The right to vote or not to vote for a candidate in an election is the inherent right of the voter. Of course, there is no denying that participation in elections is a part of one’s civic duty but participating in elections is one thing and voting in one’s favour is a completely different matter. Countries including Australia, Belgium, Greece and many countries in Latin America principally believe in compulsory voting (as a duty) raising the issue of participation. They have taken voting duty so seriously that they impose sanctions/punishment on the non-voters, having introduced the laws. In our legal framework, there is no provision to show dissatisfaction with the number of votes given to the candidates, due to which even if the participation of the people in the voting process is seen, the real result as per the will of the people cannot be revealed. Therefore, for the real existence of the right to vote, it is necessary to make provision for rejecting all candidates and to exercise it and give it legal recognition.",political
Biplav Maoists to foil November 20 elections,"Kathmandu, November 1 The Maoist party led by Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’ has decided to foil the  November 20 elections  for the House of Representatives and seven provincial assemblies.

"Nepal’s electing lawmakers, but candidates promise physical infrastructure development and nothing else","Gyan Khatri, 77, from Saidhaki in  Ghorahi sub-metropolitan city  in Dang has been voting since the Panchayat era. Every time the elections are near, he is full of excitement as he gets hopeful with all the dreams about physical infrastructure development that different politicians sell him. He also likes how leaders come and listen to his issues. “Now, all I want them to do is give us access to drinking water. That’s it,” says Khatri. Leaders since the Panchayat era have been promising people like Khatri that they will get drinking water in their homes. But, even though most homes now have a tap, they do not have access to running water. Many leaders have come and gone and know what the locals need. They have even promised people like Khatri, but have not fulfilled their promises. Now at 77, Khatri feels like the leaders have disrespected people like him. He feels they do not value or respect them as they always seem to fulfil promises made to people they value. “We have to walk an hour to get water even during the monsoon. It feels unfair,” says Khatri.  But, it is not only about the intention of these politicians. In fact, they do not have much power as far as physical infrastructure development is concerned. Yet, hundreds of candidates have been giving out fake promises to get the votes of the public who are always hopeful things might change. This is what the candidates for the  upcoming federal and provincial elections  are doing.  These candidates are going door to door, promising drinking water, roads, bridges and other infrastructure development. Most voters believe them, which shows how the voters and candidates are similar. The voters do not know what a federal and provincial lawmaker can and cannot do nor do they know their limitations. Without knowing this, these people happily go and vote for a candidate believing the change they want will happen this time. Deceiving the electorate House of Representative candidate for Kathmandu 2, Onsari Gharti Magar, knows the roles and responsibilities of a lawmaker. “A leader wants to develop the country, not just one constituency. That is my goal too,” says Magar, who has also served as a house speaker in the past. But during her campaigning, she is contradicting this statement as she is also seen promising physical infrastructure development. During one of his recent speeches, Magar yelled, “If I become a lawmaker, I’ll make sure I’ll end the traffic congestion at Koteshwor.”  In the same event, she also said she would resign from her post as a lawmaker if the Jorpati-Sankhu road section is not completed within two years. She also wants to develop Sankhu as a tourist destination and solve the flooding issues in Dakshin Dhoka and Mulpani. She also promised to complete the Mulpani cricket ground. Adding to Magar’s comment, Maoist Centre chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal added that he would make Magar a minister looking after physical infrastructure development. Dahal himself during a rally in Gorkha promised to get the Palungtar airport into operation. Pancha Karna Rai, a former lawmaker and provincial assembly member candidate from Kotang is taking things to another level. During his campaign, he is carrying a poster with him claiming he played a role in building a bridge in Jayaramghar. But, he did not play a major role as all he did was be a consultant. To gain votes, many lawmakers and leaders are going door to door with their infrastructure development plans. Roads, bridges, schools and temples are on many of their agendas. This, they feel gives them a better chance to get votes as it has been tried and trusted method for years. “People want to see development. It’s in the psyche so that’s what we do,” says a candidate. Rangamati Shahi, an outgoing lawmaker, says that Nepali leaders have failed to come out of this trend as they believe they can only get votes if they claim to fulfil the small demands of the people. But, most lawmakers, after getting elected, do little to nothing as they just do not have the power or the influence to create any change unless they become ministers, says Shahi. Knowing the roles Even the country’s constitution and laws do not tie lawmakers to physical infrastructure development. The role of a lawmaker is to make policies and laws to govern the country. But, during the election campaigning, it feels like the people are not voting for lawmakers but voting for local development officers instead. “To win the election, they are saying anything they want. But, no one actually thinks about what they can actually do as a lawmaker because some people can’t do anything,” says Shahi. The constitution governs the lawmakers and what they can and cannot do. The constitution clearly states the role of both federal and provincial lawmakers is to draft bills, policies and long-term plans.  They are also tasked with discussing bills and making them comprehensive before they are passed, bringing new bills themselves and raising issues plaguing the country. There are even many examples in Nepal where lawmakers have influenced long-term policies through resolutions. Lawmakers in 1991 brought policies regarding economic, trade and industrial liberalisation. In 1994, the government then put forward issues regarding the need for social security. These two policies are still considered very important decisions for the country’s long-term growth.  Another example of a progressive policy is the country becoming a democracy. The house also passed a resolution to give 33 per cent reservation to women in public positions. Thile resolution is even implemented by the house itself. Many also remember the laws drafted in 2011 that helped change caste-based discrimination issues in the country.   “The proposal that was put forward in 2011 is the foundation stone for the change in case-based discrimination. We can see Dalits and other castes at the national level offices, which is good news,” says former chair of Nepal Law Commission, Madhav Poudel. But, the lawmakers who came after that have failed to work towards the long-term development of the country. Even the lawmakers have failed to put some bills they want in the house which shows how ineffective they can be. The tied hands Another role of the lawmaker is to draft the country’s budget including that for physical infrastructure development. They make laws on how much tax needs to be collected from which sector, which will then become the country’s main source of revenue. Such is the role of the House of Representatives that the Finance Bill is only presented in the lower house. The National Assembly can suggest changes, but it cannot amend the bill as that role is given only to the House of Representatives. This is why a lawmaker needs to be aware of the budget and the country’s finances. Any failure to do so can result in long-term problems for the country. Despite that, the country leaders, rather than attending discussions on budget, go from ministry to ministry asking for money so they can fulfil infrastructure development promises they made to the people. “Lawmakers feel they have to go to ministries and be close to senior leaders to get anything done. This is still the case today,” says Shahi. A lawmaker also is tasked with forming the government.  The constitution states this. But this has resulted in many lawmakers getting in the race to become ministers. In a bid to become ministers, lawmakers have been agreeing to anything the ruling party leader says. Those who become ministers do some infrastructure development work in their constituencies, but many lawmakers who do not get to become ministers, are left empty-handed with no development work being done. There are many who say that many lawmakers have not been able to explain their actual role to the people. Even just because they have become ministers, they cannot use up the country’s budget to make a bridge or road in a specific area. Lack of awareness among voters about this is creating major issues, say experts. As this is happening, the candidates take advantage of the lack of awareness and say ‘I’ll do it” to whatever the voter asks them for. Knowing the limits The constitution of the country does not state that a lawmaker can play a role in physical infrastructure development. So when a lawmaker says they will carry out specific development works in their constituencies, they are just doing so to gain votes. Even a minister does not have such power. Former chair of the Law Commission, Paudel says while a lawmaker can practically declare their commitment to facilitate physical infrastructure development, it is wrong for them to say that they will do this. “They can say they will put pressure on the government to do a particular thing but saying ‘I’ll do it’ is a lie. They don’t have the authority to do so,” says Paudel, who adds this can only be done by the local and provincial executives.  All the lawmakers can do, according to Paudel, is offer suggestions on what might be an important project and why. And, even, their suggestions are not legally binding.  This story was translated from the original  Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
November 20 elections: Ruling alliance makes public the list of its official candidates,"Kathmandu, November 28 As the  November 20 elections  are coming closer, the ruling alliance has made public the list of its official candidates across the country for both federal and provincial legislative bodies.

Who is the prime ministerial candidate from the ruling alliance?,"After CPN-UML decided to put forward its party chairman KP Sharma Oli as the candidate for the prime minister, the party leaders have repeatedly questioned the ruling coalition and asked who is its candidate for the prime minister.  At the forefront of asking such questions is UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel. Pokhrel, who was a key player in the decision, has been asking the leaders of the ruling coalition from the public platforms: Who is the future prime minister of the five-party coalition? The party central committee meeting held on August 27 decided to go to the  November 20 elections  by again hailing Oli as the leader of the government if it gets a chance.  When the leaders of the ruling coalition did not show interest in answering, Oli stepped forward and challenged Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to face him in a live debate and discuss their agenda. On October 18, he  wrote on his social media accounts,  “I am ready for this, are you, Deubaji?” The ruling coalition, however, which made a public appeal to vote for the coalition’s candidates, has neither announced its candidate for the future PM nor shown interest in the election debate. So, who will lead the next government if the coalition wins? Keeping it hush-hush But, then, the leaders who do not want to announce the future prime minister have started to present themselves as contenders for the post. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has announced that he will contest the parliamentary party election after the general elections for the prime minister’s position. He says, “This year, we will compete for the premiership. I don’t know if it can be done or not.”  Thapa is also supported by another general secretary, Bishwa Prakash Sharma. He says he is ready to nominate Thapa for the PM after being elected as a member of parliament. Senior Congress leader Ram Chandra Paudel has not hidden his desire to become the prime minister in recent days. He has expressed his desire and courage to work in executive positions in public forums. CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has also presented himself as a contender in the race. In a  recent interview on Himalaya TV , he says, “If the opportunity arises, I have an aspiration to show what I have in store to lead the country and establish what is about economic development.” According to the leaders, while there are many contenders for the premiership in the coalition, power-sharing might also depend on the election results. Therefore, the coalition will announce the prime ministerial candidate only after the elections. “We are all united and focused on the elections to get a majority in the parliament. At this time, rather than talking about anything else, we are focused on the current goal is to secure the majority,” says Nepali Congress leader Paudel.  Senior Maoist Centre vice-chairperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha also says that they are now focusing on the elections. “There has not been any discussion among the coalition about the prime minister or the structure of the government. We are focused on forming a coalition government.” Musical chairs, again! The leaders of the ruling coalition have said that the overall consensus on “power sharing” will be reached only after the elections. However, there seems to be almost a consensus on sharing the term of the premiership. “I have found an understanding between the leaders,” says Paudel. Nepali Congress central member Min Bahadur Bishwakarma also hopes for the sharing of the term for the premiership. After the elections, the first government will be led by the Congress, he informs. During the next reshuffle, the prime minister may be from the Maoists in the second turn. In the rotation, Deuba can put forward his name from Congress. But, he is sure to face a challenge in the parliamentary party. Bishwakarma, a leader close to Deuba, says, “There are plenty of aspirants, but a majority should be secured in the parliamentary party. The one who can convince many parliamentarians becomes the prime minister.” In the Maoist Centre, Dahal does not have any competitors to block him. Shrestha says, “We are hopeful that Prachanda (Dahal) will be the prime minister of the next government.” This story was translated from the original  Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

UML’s Shankar Pokhrel copying Nepali Congress manifesto cover for his election post,"Kathmandu, October 17 CPN-UML General Secretary  Shankar Pokhrel’s Facebook  post, calling people to vote for him in the  November elections , has turned controversial among social media users.

However, apparently, the old sketch used by the Nepali Congress has been copied by him directly. “We have a dedicated team to prepare publishing materials. The post might have matched with the Congress picture as they were unaware of it,” Pokharel’s personal secretary Saroj Regmi says. After criticism, Pokhrel deleted the post without any comment.",political
Janalokpal Aayog in Madhesh couldn’t settle a single case even by spending Rs 22 million,"Janakpur, October 17 The  Madhesh provincial government  last year established Janalokpal Aayog, a new anti-corruption commission. However, the commission could not settle a single case in the first year. Yet, the commission spent Rs 22 million in the period, as per its first annual report submitted to Province Chief (Governor) Hari Shankar Mishra on Sunday.  The report says Rs 22 million and 46,316 has been spent on office management, vehicle purchase and salary and benefits of the officials. In the reporting period (establishment on September 7, 2021, till July 16, 2022), the commission received 15 complaints, but it failed to make any decision about them. “Most of the complaints are about  corruption and irregularities at the local level ,” the report reads, “These complaints are being processed.” The report says the complaints could not be addressed on time as only one official-level staffer is deployed at the anti-corruption commission.",political
Nepal elections 2022: How regional parties are losing control over the Madhesh province,"If the results of the upcoming parliamentary elections, scheduled for November, will be different from the 2017 elections in any way, they will be most deeply felt in the Madhesh province which includes eight districts of Nepal’s southeast.  Even though there are some promising  independent candidates , the main competition, across the country, is likely to be against the two major coalitions: one led by the Nepali Congress and the other by CPN-UML.  The Nepali Congress-led coalition includes the Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha. The CPN-UML-led coalition on the other hand has Janata Samajbadi Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) and RPP-Nepal (Kamal Thapa). So, unlike the last elections, Nepal will see a battle between the two major political forces in the Madhesh province also. In 2017, things were different as the partnership between the Federal Socialist Forum (FSFN) and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal (RJPN), led by Upendra Yadav and Mahantha Thakur respectively, meant there were three alliances in the Madhesh province, and the results were in favour of the Madheshi alliance. The FSFN-RJPN coalition, despite facing stiff competition from the then UML-Maoist Centre alliance and Nepali Congress, won the highest number of seats in the Madhesh province, shocking both parties. But, this year, two major Madhesh-centric forces–Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSPN) and Mahantha Thakur’s Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP)–have sought help from the two major coalitions. This has given a bad message as these parties, which went toe-to-toe with major forces, seem to have given up. The paradigm shift Political analyst Chandrakishore says major political parties have never liked Madheshi parties being a major force and have tried to decrease their influence in the Madhesh province time and again. “It seems they’ve finally been successful in doing so as I know for a fact they haven’t liked these parties being an alternative force,” says Chandrakishore. And, he is right. This is the first time since the 1999 elections that the major political parties have established themselves in the Madesh province. In between, the scene was dominated by different Madhesh-centric political parties as most of them came to rise in the first Constituent Assembly elections in 2008. After that, parties like Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML were almost ineffective in the region.  The rise of Madheshi regional forces was also important for the constitution as many essential features in the charter were added thanks to the pressure and perseverance of these parties. But, now, as Madheshi leaders are not on the same page, major political parties’ presence is back in Madhesh province after a hiatus of 24 years. The two parties, JSPN and LSP, recently even switched their sides on the eve of the candidate registration. The JSPN was part of the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government. But, after a dispute about the seats, its leaders decided to leave the Nepali Congress-led coalition and joined hands with the CPN-UML. On the contrary, the LSP, which was trying to work with the CPN-UML, joined hands with the ruling alliance. This is bad news for them as they are likely to get fewer seats in this round of elections compared to 2017 as the LSP has been promised just eight House of Representatives seats while the JSPN has been promised 17. In the 2017 elections, the two parties together got 19 seats from the Madhesh province alone.  “This should be seen as a victory for the establishment that failed to meet the demands of the Madheshis during the drafting of the constitution. I think this shows how Madheshi leaders have failed badly,” says Chandrakishore, who feels the identity that Madheshi parties had created after a long struggle has now vanished. The rising action It took a lot of effort for Madheshi leaders to stand up against the establishment. It was like the people standing up to the autocratic Rana regime. As the Rana regime ended, people like Raghunath Thakur, Bedananda Jha, Durgananda Jha, Raghunath Raya Yadav and Satya Dev Mani Tripathi tried to raise issues that were plaguing the people of Madhesh. They even announced a Madhesh Mukti Andolan and demanded the state listen to the issues of the people of Madhesh. Bedananda Jha even formed a Terai Congress to raise demands such as people from Madhesh get employed as civil servants, the Hindi language be recognised by the state and Madhesh be an autonomous state. The Terai Congress took part in the 1959 elections in the country but none of its leaders won; it did get 0.07 of the total votes. But, once the Panchayat system was put in place by King Mahendra, things started to take an ugly turn.  In 1963, Durga Nanda Jha, in revolt against the system, exploded a bomb in Janakpur. After the state found out, Durga Nanda along with the people who helped him–Ramji Mishra, Raghunath Raya Yadav and Satya Dev Mani Tripathi–were killed.  But, that did not stop people from today’s Madhesh province from questioning. People kept on pushing for change. When a referendum was held on May 3, 1979, a lot of people voted for Nepal to become a multi-party democracy. Madhesh was once again unhappy when  Harka Gurung  prepared a report in 1983 that stated that a lot of Indians had settled in Nepal, particularly in Madhesh. Ram Janam Tiwari, Gajendra Narayan Singh, and Ram Chandra Mishra formed Nepal Sadbhawana Parishad and wrote to the king stating this was wrong.  After the establishment of multiparty democracy in 1990, Nepal Sadbhawana Party was formed under the leadership of Gajendra Narayan Singh, Badri Prasad Mandal and Hridayesh Tripathi. Following that, the voices of the people of Madhesh started to reach Kathmandu on a regular basis. But, despite this, Nepali Congress and CPN-UML dominated the political scene in the Madhesh province as the Sadbhawana Party only won six seats in the 1991 elections. In 1994, it won three seats and in 1999, it won five seats.  The reason why it did not do well in the elections was the internal politics within the party and its failure to make public its agenda at the national level. The climax After the monarchy was overthrown in 2008, the Madhesh province then continued to try to find its identity in Nepali politics. Upendra Yadav came to rise with the Madeshi Andolan. The protest started a new wave in Madheshi politics as more political parties were formed as a result to contest the 2008 elections.  Leaders quitting major parties and wanting to put Madhesh first formed the Terai Madhesh Loktantrik Party on December 27, 2007. All key Madheshi leaders like Manhantha Thakur, Hridayesh Tripathi, Brishesh Chandra Lal, Mahindra Raya Yadav, Ram Chandra Yadav and Jitendra Sonal joined the party. Sadbhawana Party continued to exist, but there were internal disputes within the party. Despite all that, the Madeshi parties stamped their authority in the 2008 elections as major parties failed to do anything there. Besides the Madhesh province, the parties even won seats in today’s Province 1, Lumbini and Sudurpaschim.  The 2008 elections, to this day, hold a special place in the heart of the Madheshis as they won 87 seats. Thanks to the movement, Ram Baran Yadav, a Madheshi, became the country’s first president.  The falling action But, what happened then was most of these leaders became power-hungry. With all of them wanting power, the parties started to spilt. The Madheshi Janaadhikar Forum Nepal, which was the fourth biggest force in Nepali politics and the biggest in the Madhesh province in 2008, split in 2010. Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar played a major role in splitting the Upendra Yadav-led party and joined the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led government. By 2017, Gachhadar packed his bags and joined Nepali Congress, when he had come from.  After that, the Madheshi parties continued to split. The first Constituent Assembly failed to draft the constitution and the Madheshi parties had to pay the price for it as Madhesh-centric parties only won 12 seats in the second Constituent Assembly elections in 2013. This was mostly because of a lack of coordination. The constitution was then drafted, but Madhesh was not happy. But the major parties did not care and went ahead which resulted in multiple protests in the region. People died and the country underwent a six-month-long blockade. The leaders knew that the reason they were not taken seriously by the establishment was that they were divided. In order not to be bullied, they decided to contest the 2017 elections in the Madhesh province as one. The Rastriya Janata Party and the Federal Socialist Forum worked together to contest the elections and won 19 seats compared to 13 by Nepali Congress, Maoists and the UML combined. They dominated the provincial elections too as they won 44 seats and formed the provincial government. Even though the Nepal Communist Party had the provincial government everywhere else, in the Madhesh province, it could not lay a glove. The RJP and FSFN merged to form the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. By early 2020, the JSPN had 34 lawmakers in the House of Representatives.  But, KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House created issues within the JSP. When  Oli dissolved the House on December 20, 2020 , Upendra Yadav protested and stood against him despite being in the coalition. But, people like Mahantha Thakur and Rajendra Mahato did not speak out against Oli, which was seen as silent support. That created a further divide in the JSPN, the biggest player in the Madhesh province. Oli dissolved the House again  on May 21, 2021. By this time, the JSPN was already politically divided.  Upendra Yadav, wanting to save the House, signed a document to make Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. But, Thakur and others did not sign and instead said they will support Oli. Following that, the JSPN split. Both parties tried to claim the JSPN was theirs and wrote to the Election Commission. The commission  decided in favour of Upendra Yadav . After that Deuba also brought an Ordinance on Political Parties, which helped  Thakur form LSP . This difference meant the two major political leaders do not work together in the elections, which has given the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML a chance to take control of the Madhesh province. “We didn’t want to join this coalition, but sadly, the circumstances are unavoidable,” says a leader from the JSPN. “But, this doesn’t mean the Madhesh movement was a failure. The fight goes on.” This story was translated from the original  Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
The curious case of Nepal’s reluctance to use electronic voting machines,"The first Constituent Assembly elections in Nepal, held in 2008, were an important milestone in Nepal’s political history for they let the people’s representatives write the country’s primary law on their own. But, for Neil Kantha Uprety, an election commissioner then, they were more important because they let the public use electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the first time. “That was a pilot project, and that proved successful,” Uprety says, “We were excited about its prospects in Nepal.” While the voting machines were used for the first time in one constituency of Kathmandu, the excitement led the commission to expand it to six constituencies in the by-elections held the next year. The use of the EVMs in two constituencies of Morang, and one each of Dhanusha, Kaski, Rolpa, and Kanchanpur. But, that was the last time Nepal used electronic machines in its nationwide general elections so far. The use of electronic voting machines is not a debated issue per se, but why Nepal does not adopt this modern system is a curious case. Before every election, the issue gets into the limelight with the urban public raising demands for its use whereas the rural electorate remains innocent. Whereas the Election Commission was urging the government to make necessary arrangements to use voting machines for the upcoming federal and provincial parliamentary elections, this is  not happening this time either . Overall, why the reluctance still exists is a mystery.  The regression The use of voting machines in 2008 was an encouraging move, remembers Uprety. This encouragement was also reflected in The Carter Center’s  election observation report , “A pilot test of electronic voting machines in Kathmandu went well, a promising sign for future elections.”   But, that promise has not been realised in any other elections so far. In the 2017 federal and provincial polls, the  commission discussed with parties  the use of voting machines, but the political parties, especially Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre rejected the idea.    Nonetheless, CPN-UML and Rastriya Prajatantra Party used voting machines in their latest general conventions to elect party leadership. But, the ruling Nepali Congress party made its members cast their  ballot papers into a water tank . The party did not bother getting trolled for that.  It is hence ironic that the leaders promise a smart city, but the same leaders are rejecting the idea of an electronic voting system.  The current voting system of Nepal is not only traditional but also expensive and time-consuming. For instance, in the recently held local elections, the Election Commission  printed  around 20 million ballot papers, which cost Rs 110 million. Similarly, it also took the authorities a long time to count the votes.  Almost two weeks after the elections, the commission completed the vote counting of the Kathmandu metropolitan city.   Scientist Ram Rimal, the designer of Samyak-100, an electronic voting machine, says that there are more benefits to using EVMs. “It creates transparency; there will be no chances of disqualification of votes; it is a one-time investment and it provides results quickly,” Rimal summarises. “If a country conducts the elections through EVMs, it does not need to spend millions on a ballot paper every election,” says Rimal.  The frowning fear Uprety, who later also worked as the chief election commission, agrees. Once voting machines are used, the chances of poll rigging are almost zero, he highlights, adding this might be the reason why the parties are reluctant to use them.  “There are cases in our country where the election booths have been captured and ballot papers are torn,” says Uprety. “Political parties fear that they cannot do that once the EVMs are used.”  Some party leaders also confess this. Congress leader Chandra Bhandari also sees the immediate need for voting machines to maintain transparency and save time during the elections. “The fear among the political leaders about the technology is something that makes the country avoid EVMs,” says Bhandari. “The political leaders neither believe in themselves nor in technology.”  The government’s role   UML deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal, meanwhile, blames the government for not introducing the system. “We are very positive about it; we even used it in our general convention,” he says, “Its unavailability, for which the government has to be blamed, is the only thing that is depriving us.”   Scientist Rimal says the commission needs to put additional effort to change the voting methodology of the country. He says rather than political leaders, it is the commission that is reluctant to introduce EVMs. “Despite our continuous efforts, the commission does not show any strong willingness.” But, the commission has its own problem. Surya Prasad Aryal, the assistant spokesperson at the commission, says, “We are well aware of the benefits of electronic voting machines, but the difficulties in managing resources due to the government’s indifference and the reluctance of political parties propelled us to follow the traditional voting method.” In addition, it is uncertain and unsure in the country when the elections will take place. Due to this, the concerned authority lacks sufficient time to the preparation for conducting elections through EVMs, says former chief election commission Uprety.",political
BP Koirala’s socialism: What Nepal needs now for the dream to materialise,"As defined by the 16  US President Abraham Lincoln,  democracy is the government of the people , by the people and for the people. To achieve that, little moments and struggles for democracy in Nepal existed from earlier periods, but the first influential democratic movement in Nepal was the  historic armed revolution of 1951  led by the Nepali Congress party under the leadership of BP Koirala.  This movement not only overthrew the autocratic Rana regime, which ruled the country for 104 years but also paved a path for the general elections for the first time ever in the country. But, Koirala’s ultimate dream of establishing socialism in the country is not achieved yet. So what Nepal needs to make it happen is still a relevant question today.   BP Koirala’s socialist dream Nepali Congress won the first elections held in the country in 1959, securing a two-thirds majority. BP Koirala became the first elected Prime Minister of the country. His government, however, was shortlived as King Mahendra shortly dissolved it to introduce the partyless Panchayat system. But, outside the government or in the government, BP Koirala always had the same goal: socialism. He repeated this in his articles and interviews saying that democracy is not the final goal but is the medium for establishing socialism in the country.  He, while in government also took several revolutionary steps for this purpose. Abolishing the birta system as well as caste discrimination with the help of industrialisation, developing policies for raising the country’s economy and more were the major steps taken by the Koirala-led government for the sake of bringing socialism to the country before the military coup. As the democracy was rooted out again, the founding leaders—BP Koirala and Subarna Shamsher—kept fighting for democracy until their last breath. They took democracy, not as the final goal but as a means for establishing socialism. Today, after the contribution of thousands of martyrs and leaders, the country has its democracy. There is nothing to stop the development activities led by the democratic government. Still, Nepali people are not satisfied with their country’s leaders claiming themselves to become the pioneer and protectors of democracy.  Failure of BP Koirala’s socialism Nepali Congress, the party that led all the democratic movements and that claims to follow the philosophy of democratic socialism advocated by its founder BP Koirala, has failed to deliver even while leading the government time and again.  Poverty, unemployment, and the lack of proper healthcare facilities and education are still the main issues in the country as in the past. The immense potential of development has not been utilised well. So what have they done for bringing socialism? Is democracy the final goal? Of course not, it is just a medium for bringing socialism into the country, but the current leaders have made democracy the medium to establish their own autocratic rules. The same group of persons have been in the leading position of the party for the last few decades and still, they seem to have their unjustifiable hunger for power. Misuse of authority, corruption, and unnatural alliances are common. We can find that the leaders who once get into power focus on gaining more power and remaining in that position for a longer period. For the sake of this purpose, they do not hesitate to commit the actions forbidden by the ground-level party cadres and the Nepali people. What’s the solution? The solution to this has been given by the current general secretary of the Nepali Congress party, Bishwa Prakash Sharma. He frequently talks about the “one, two, three, four” principle, which limits a person to become the president only once, prime minister twice, minister thrice and member of parliament for four times.  If the constitution is amended and this system is followed, we can limit the unjustifiable hunger for power in the top-level politicians and help the nation grow. Knowing that they have got limited time to remain in the position, the leaders focus on doing people-friendly activities rather than cadre-friendly activities.  This ultimately helps Nepal establish the much-awaited democratic socialism imagined by leader BP Koirala. So, the Nepali Congress party should first incorporate Sharma’s advocated principle in its party constitution and should raise its voice to amend the constitution as well.  In the upcoming elections too, the party should go to the people with the agenda of incorporating the ‘one, two, three, four’ principle in the constitution and should give a chance to the fresh leaders to lead. Otherwise, the dream of BP Koirala establishing democratic socialism may not fulfil and the party’s future too may remain at stake.",political

Corruption and crime accused can contest Nepal elections but can’t take up positions: The loophole explained,"Govinda Raj Joshi, a person who has been convicted of corruption by the Special Court, registered his name to contest the Nepal elections for the House of Representatives membership from Tanahun 1. He was already removed by the Nepali Congress party as its member after he showed his desire to contest the election from the constituency that senior leader Ram Chandra Paudel also claimed. Following his expulsion from the party, Joshi filed his candidacy independently.  In 2017, his candidacy was voided by the Returning Officer’s Office. But, this time, he has been allowed to contest. Similarly, former deputy prime minister Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar also gave his name to contest the elections from Sunsari 3. Gachhadar has been  accused of irregularity  in the  Lalita Niwa land case , which is currently sub-judice at the Special Court. He was released on bail of Rs 1 million by the court. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Bikram Pandey also registered his name from Chitwan 3. Pandey had also been accused of corruption in the  Sikta Irrigation Project , but the Special Court did not find him guilty. But, the  Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority  (CIAA) has challenged the decision at the Supreme Court as it believes Pandey is guilty. If he is found guilty, he will be suspended from his position as a lawmaker should he win.  It is clear that even if these people win the Nepal elections, they will not be able to become lawmakers as they have not been acquitted by the courts. However, there is no law to bar them from contesting the elections, and experts say this loophole in the election law has made people question the integrity of the parties and candidates. The legal provisions In the anti-corruption law, there is a provision that those accused of corruption but not acquitted by the court cannot hold public office. The CIAA itself writes to the government asking it to not allow those accused or convicted to assume office. Yet, these people have time again given their names to contest the Nepal elections despite their shady past. Laws have determined the criteria to become a candidate for the House of Representatives and the provincial assemblies. If a person has been convicted of a criminal case, s/he will have to wait two years after serving the sentence to file candidacy in the Nepal elections. Unless they do that, they cannot register their names.  The law also forbids people convicted of corruption, rape, human trafficking, money laundering and kidnapping from filing their names. People who’ve been given life imprisonment are also forbidden from contesting elections. Guru Prasad Wagle, a deputy spokesperson of the  Election Commission , says that Nepal’s law cannot stop people in jail accused of a crime from contesting the election. “Only people who have been convicted of a crime can’t be candidates,” says Wagle. Govinda Raj Joshi, a former minister, who has been facing corruption charges for the past 18 years has time and again tried to become a candidate. The Special Court has convicted him of corruption but the Supreme Court has asked the Special Court to review its decision. The case is still sub-judice at the Supreme Court as the Special Court believes that Joshi is guilty of corruption. As the final verdict is yet to come out, Joshi is allowed to contest the Nepal election. Gachhadar was also given a ticket, but he too has been accused of corruption in the Lalita Niwas case. Following the accusation, he was even  suspended as a lawmaker  but since the case is still ongoing, he is allowed to contest the election. Resham Chaudhary was accused of a murder case but was yet to be convicted when he  ran and won  the 2017 House of Representatives election in Kailali. Despite being elected, he remained on the run for many months before  surrendering to the c ourt and being sent to jail, thereby  losing the lawmaker’s position . He tried to file a candidacy again on Sunday. But, the Election Commission has said that  Chaudhary will not be allowed  to contest the Nepal election as he is serving his imprisonment now. In response to complaints received by respective returning officers, the officers decided they do not meet the criteria to run in the polls as per the  House of Representatives Election Act, 2017 . Automatic suspension if elected Election Commission officials say even if people accused of crime and corruption win any of the Nepal elections, they will not be able to work as lawmakers as they will be suspended indefinitely.  For those accused of corruption, the CIAA ensures that they are not allowed to work as lawmakers as it writes to the commission asking it not to allow them. “The CIAA writes to the commission in these cases and we move ahead according. We did this during the local Nepal elections also,” says the spokesperson of the CIAA, Shyam Prasad Bhandari. “Until the court acquits them, they will remain suspended.” But, this feels wrong, say experts. They argue that those who cannot take office should not be allowed to contest the elections. And if they are allowed to contest, they should not be barred from taking office if they win. This, they feel, undermines the votes of the people. CIAA’s Bhandari says this will remain the case until the current Nepal election laws are in place. “The law doesn’t allow corrupt people to take office. We make sure that the law is followed,” he says. “The election laws might be different and we have nothing to say on that.” The corruption-accused people are suspended for fear that these people may use their influence to hide the proof against them as the case would still be ongoing. This is why people accused of corruption are suspended and not allowed to take office. Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, has this provision. But, the Nepal election law contradicts it and does not stop them from being candidates. Officials know that one of these laws must be amended, but the Election Commission cannot do anything to get one of them amended.  CIAA officials, however, argue that since corruption-accused government workers are not eligible for promotion and cannot even participate in the competition of the Public Service Commission, the politicians should also not be allowed to contest Nepal elections if accused of corruption.

Ruling alliance to back ‘UML rebel’ Prabhu Sah in Rautahat,"Kathmandu, October 13 The ruling alliance has decided to back Prabhu Sah, a leader  who rejected the CPN-UML’s nomination  to contest the House of Representatives election independently in Rautahat 3. The CPN-Maoist Centre’s Deputy General Secretary Barsha Man Pun says the Maoist Centre candidate Ravindra Patel, who has filed his candidacy on behalf of the ruling party, will be convinced to withdraw his candidacy although the time given by the  Election Commission  for that has been over. It means the Maoist Centre candidate will be there legally, but he will also solicit votes for Sah.  If that happens, Sah is highly likely to win the election as the main opposition, CPN-UML, does not have any candidate there. Sah himself was given the UML nomination, but he ditched it without letting the party leadership know on time, thereby making the party nominating someone else impossible. Sah was in the CPN-Maoist Centre previously.  Earlier, the ruling alliance has already decided to support UML dissident Ghana Shyam Bhusal in Rupandehi.

"With imprudent candidate selection, party leaders frustrate the public and experts alike","With parliamentary elections coming near, people ideally should have been more excited for the candidates they are voting for. However, after some promising aspirants did not get a chance to file nominations on behalf of their parties, people look more frustrated than ever. That frustration with the candidate selection process can be seen in the social media posts of netizens in Nepal. Along with the public, many political observers and experts are unhappy with the way the party heads have chosen the candidates. For them, the way the party heads have selected Nepal election candidates has  not given a promising future for the country’s democracy .  The imprudent picks Nepali Congress did not give an election ticket to economist Swarnim Wagle. Despite Wagle being an internationally known economist, he could not impress Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba’s candidate selection radar even though many within the party wanted him to contest the election.    Wagle is not only an intellectual and promising person from NC who will be deprived of contesting in elections. Govinda Raj Pokharel will also not be contesting the elections along with another prominent and respected Nepali Congress leader Minendra Rijal. The condition of CPN-UML, the main opposition party, is also similar to the ruling party.  It also did not field election tickets to some prominent figures. The most notable ones are senior leaders Bhim Rawal and Ghanashyam Bhusal. The Maoist Centre has also followed a similar path. People who questioned the leadership of chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal such as Haribol Gajurel and Lekhnath Neupane have been deprived of nominations.      Netizens’ reaction Such a way of candidate selection has created hullabaloo in the Nepali political scene and they are also largely receiving criticism from netizens in Nepal. Meanwhile, people are also questioning the nature of party heads.  “Congress not offering  Swarnim Wagle  an election ticket and similar things with other parties explain how the parties are being operated as private companies controlled completely by one person at the top, not caring for public interests at all,”  tweets  Paribesh.    There are many others like him showing disappointment at candidate selections on social media platforms. Kul Chandra Gautam, a former UN assistant secretary-general, writes, “Failure to induct, retain and promote folks like   Swarnim Wagle, Minendra Rijal, Mahesh Acharya and any notable women leaders for a sustained period is a blot on the Nepali Congress’s credentials as a progressive party with a visionary agenda,” writes Gautam on Twitter. “Hard to beat   Sher Bahadur Deuba’s cunning myopia!”   The CPN-UML is also largely receiving flak from the netizens in Nepal for their decision to deprive Rawal and Bhusal of election tickets.  “It’s unfortunate that Bhim Rawal is dismissed. The UML leadership will definitely lose many well-wishers like us,”  tweets  Roshan Jung Thapa.  “A narcissistic decision by KP Oli instead of making the party strong, I wonder why this weakening decision was made. Disgraceful. Bhim Rawal is an asset to the whole country!” Dissatisfied with the candidate selection process, some have revolted against their parties. For instance, Bhusal has now left the UML to contest on his own from Rupandehi-1 and will be supported by the Nepali Congress-Maoist coalition.   Similarly, the leaders of the CPN-Maoist Centre in Dhankuta announced mass resignation on September 26.  Altogether 150  district leaders, including Hemraj Bhandari, a politburo member of the party, quit after the party’s decision to form an alliance with other parties.  Implications There is a general feeling amongst everyone that potential leaders did not get into the candidate selection process because they constantly questioned their party head and their leadership and that, many believe, has come back to haunt them as they never wanted to please the party heads just to be on their good side. “The way the party heads has chosen the candidate will weaken democracy,” says political analyst Jagat Nepal.  Observers say that the heads of political parties have exposed their bias and arrogant and undemocratic nature while selecting candidates for the upcoming general elections.  According to them, rather than choosing the genuine ones, the party heads have selected the persons who would meet their vested interests and benefit them economically and politically.    “Earlier as well, the candidate selection would adopt the same method, but the graph of such an unethical practice has increased this time,” says Nepal, adding, ”This practice creates political instability and also demotivates the right persons from politics.”  Nepal believes this is high time for the public to use their conscience and punish the political parties by boycotting their undeserving candidates.   Another political analyst Shyam Shrestha says that the heads of political parties have greatly disrespected democracy.  He says that the chiefs of political parties do not want to be questioned and expose their wrongdoings and in that regard, they chose someone who would please them in any condition.  “Unless the candidate selection system changes, the undemocratic nature of party heads will continue prevailing,” says Shrestha. Shrestha also wants the public to use their conscience and fairly choose the right candidate. This could be the only thing that would make the political party realise their mistakes.   “The political parties should also set standard criteria for their candidate selection,” says Shrestha. “They should form a committee that would transparently choose the right person.“   Rather than an individual, a majority of a transparent committee should decide who should get election tickets, he adds.",political
UML backs Nepali Congress rebel candidate in Chitwan 3,"Chitwan, October 12 The CPN-UML has decided to support Dinesh Koirala, the rebel candidate of the Nepali Congress party, in the House of Representatives election in Chitwan’s constituency 3. In the constituency, the Congress has not fielded its candidate as it has supported the CPN-Maoist Centre’s Bhoj Raj Adhikari for the  November 20 election . Dissatisfied with the party decision, local Congress leader Dinesh Koirala has decided to contest independently. On Wednesday, UML candidate Ram Prasad Neupane withdrew his nomination to back Koirala. “I have received blessings from UML chairman KP Sharma Oli,” Koirala says, “Now, it has been decided that I will contest the election with the UML backing officially.” Seeking UML support, Koirala met Oli on Tuesday.

"Resham Chaudhary, Laxman Tharu barred from contesting elections","Kathmandu, October 12 The  Election Commission  has barred murder convicts Resham Chaudhary and Laxman Tharu from contesting the House of Representatives elections.  The court has found both of them guilty of the  murder of some police personnel in Tikapur of Kailali in 2015 . Whereas Chaudhary is serving his sentence at Dillibazaar Prison in Kathmandu, Tharu is “absconding” following his conviction. The two had filed their nominations on behalf of the Nagarik Unmukti Party,  founded by Chaudhary under his wife Ranjita Shrestha’s leadership , in Bariya-2 and Kailali-5 constituencies. In response to complaints received by respective returning officers, the officers decided they do not meet the criteria to run in the polls as per the  House of Representatives Election Act, 2017 , as it bars people convicted of a criminal case and serving the sentence from running the elections. They, however, can contest after two years of the end of the sentence. Resham Chaudhary was accused of the murder but was yet to be convicted when he  ran and won  the 2017 House of Representatives election in Kailali.  Despite being elected, he remained on the run for many months before  surrendering to the c ourt and being sent to jail, thereby  losing the lawmaker’s position .",political
JSPN ministers getting sacked for their alliance with the UML,"Kathmandu, October 11 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba is preparing to sack  four ministers representing the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal  (JSPN) after the party left the ruling alliance and  partnered with the CPN-UML  for the November 20 elections. Dissatisfied with the sharing of constituencies among the ruling parties, the Upendra Yadav-led party approached the main opposition and ended up forming an alliance on the eve of the nomination of candidacies this Sunday.  As the party is reluctant to call back the ministers and they are unwilling to resign, the prime minister is preparing to sack them as there is no point keeping the opposition leaders in the cabinet, according to a leader close to him. Prime Minister Deuba is meeting leaders of the other members of his coalition before making the final decision. Although Deuba is sacking the JSPN ministers, he cannot appoint new ones to replace them as a Supreme  Court order has barred the prime minister  from inducting new ministers in the caretaker government when the parliament is not in existence.",political
"Nepal is a secular country, but it has some anti-secular laws. It should change now","Nepal became a secular state after the promulgation of the  2007 interim constitution . Before that, Nepal had been an official Hindu state since 1962 as declared by the  then constitution  and an unofficial Hindu state before that time. Perhaps because of that, there are still some anti-secular laws in Nepal. While anti-secular laws seem natural given the majority of the Hindu population here, it seems unfair as some  minor religious groups struggle  for their identity. The  current constitution of Nepal , which came into force in 2015, retains the state’s secular character introduced by the interim constitution in 2007. However, the present constitution defines secular to mean the protection of religion and culture being practised since ancient times. But, in that case, religious and cultural freedom can be interpreted as offering special status to Hinduism. To say that Nepal is secular is like saying there is religious freedom and the government must protect those traditional religions and customs practised since ancient times, which it seems does not apply to religions that are less ancient (or Sanatan). The same idea also governs some anti-secular laws in Nepal. Blasphemy laws: Back to Hindu state? The  Muluki Criminal Code, 2017 , which came into force in August 2018, retains a range of provisions prohibiting and criminalising proselytism, in a manner that is incompatible with international standards. But, the code also contains several vague and overly broad anti-blasphemy provisions that criminalise hurting religious sentiments and feelings. Section 156 of the code criminalises the hurting of religious sentiment, and section 158 prohibits religious conversion and undermining or jeopardising religions or faiths. The offence triggers a punishment of up to five years in custody and a fine of up to Rs 50,000. The offence also carries other consequences, for example, deportation if the offender is a foreigner. The provisions related to blasphemy in the new Penal Code are incompatible with Nepal’s international human rights obligations, including those under the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  (ICCPR). Article 18 of the ICCPR, in particular, guarantees the right of every individual to freedom of religion or belief. Nepali laws are kind of similar to blasphemy laws that exist elsewhere in the region, including in India, Pakistan and Myanmar, where their enforcement has resulted in widespread abuse, mainly because these so-called religious offences have been instrumental in the persecution of people belonging to the minority religions. Vishal Arora, a journalist based in India,  rightly questions  — Would the Nepali people see nations like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and the Maldives, whose constitutions and anti-secular laws accord special status to Islam as their role models? Are these nations peaceful? How about Buddhist Sri Lanka? Are minorities happy in Sri Lanka? Are extremist Buddhist groups protecting their religion or giving it a bad name?  Making blasphemy laws in a secular country like Nepal has welcomed these long-term problematic issues and it has become a big fallacy to say we are a citizen of a secular state.  Judiciary’s non-secular stance In the  case of Chirbahadur Gahatraj et al v Prime Minister and Council of Ministers , Nepal Law Journal 2012 (2068BS), Vol 10, Decision No 8707, justices Prakash Wasti and Kamal Narayan Das pens, “When more than 80 per cent of the population are Hindu who follow Hindu culture and religion, which has been ongoing since ancient times, the state has to preserve and protect such religion and culture.” This interpretation appears to be discriminatory and indicates a preference for Hinduism over other religions and beliefs. It hence became an example of anti-secular laws in Nepal. Similarly, the apex court’s interpretation in  the case of Charles Mendes et al v His Majesty’s Government , Nepal Law Journal 2046, Vol 6, Decision No 3855 is also relevant in this regard. In this case, it was explicitly mentioned that the constitution only protects the religion that exists from time immemorial.  This precedent is still clearly resembled in the explanation portion of Article 4 of the constitution. At the end Secularism means that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on the grounds of religion only. That means the state shall have no religion of its own and all citizens shall be equally entitled to the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practise, and propagate religion.  However, we are wrongly saying that there has been a great departure of Nepal from a Hindu-dominated nation to a secular state as there are still anti-secular laws. What are the types of secularism? Has our constitution been proposed by giving a unique definition to it? Why is the judiciary still interpreting the laws in favour of Hindu fundamentalists and monarchists who have moral and material support from the national and international power spreading Hindutva? Hence, there should be a robust debate on secularism and the existence of anti-secular laws in Nepal.",political
Nepal elections: It’s time parties held primaries to pick candidates to save democracy from themselves,"It is election season in Nepal as the country gears for its federal and provincial elections. Hundreds of candidates, both nominated by their parties and those filling their candidacies independently,  registered their names  at their respective election offices on Sunday. While there was a lot of enthusiasm amongst the candidates, there was a certain disappointment among the people who saw some aspirants from major political parties fail to get a ticket to contest the  Nepal elections in November  despite them having promising potential as people’s representatives. Apparently, the way the party heads have selected Nepal election candidates has not given a promising future for the country’s democracy. It seems it’s time the parties adopted primaries now if they really want to strengthen the system. Undemocratic democratic parties One of those names was economist Swarnim Wagle. Despite Wagle being an internationally known economist, Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba did not give him a ticket even though many within the party wanted him to contest the election. Another intellectual leader from the Nepali Congress, the biggest and oldest democratic political party in Nepal, Govinda Raj Pokharel will also not be contesting the elections along with another prominent and respected Nepali Congress leader Minendra Rijal. But, why did not these leaders get a ticket to contest the Nepal elections? What was the reason given to them? Well, almost all of them say they do not know why they were overlooked by their parties. But, there is a general feeling amongst everyone that they did not get a ticket because they constantly questioned Deuba and his leadership and that, many believe, has come back to haunt them as they never wanted to please Deuba just to be in his good side. Nepali Congress is not the only party that failed to give tickets to capable leaders ahead of the key Nepal elections. The CPN-UML also did the same that the party showed a lot of prejudiced behaviour while handing out tickets. Senior UML leader Ghanashyam Bhusal was told the party would not let him represent it in the federal elections despite his intentions to do so. He has now left the UML to contest on his own and will be supported by the Nepali Congress-Maoist coalition. The UML also did not give Bhim Rawal a ticket to contest the elections. The Maoist Centre has also followed a similar path. People who questioned the leadership of chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal have been discarded when giving a ticket as people like Haribol Gajurel and Lekhnath Neupane will not contest the elections. Go to primaries This was odd to see as the big parties created a divide among leaders of the same calibre. Some were in a position to even hand out tickets to others while others like Rawal, Bhusal, Pokharel and Rijal were left red-faced without one. This shows how the political parties have given up on their organisation structure as it feels like it is now controlled by a few narrow-minded individuals (some even outside the party) in a very undemocratic manner. This can be seen by how the big parties have handed Nepal election tickets haphazardly to people. People see this as an issue as many feel that the best candidates are not being allowed to fight in the Nepal elections. Maybe to make it less controversial, it is time Nepal also started to  conduct primaries  to ensure the candidates whom the people want to vote for come out from the parties. Maybe the  Election Commission  could oversee it too as many democratic countries around the world have been doing this. A lot of people feel that selecting a candidate is not an internal party matter. The candidates’ selection also reflects the wisdom of the leadership and that, for now, does not paint a good picture as many feel that these parties are under the control of some individuals. It is important the right people contest Nepal elections because these people do not just represent their parties, they are a major part of the country’s democratic system and if the parties cannot follow the democratic practice it shows a poor reflection of the entire system. There are a lot of questions surrounding the selection of candidates for the upcoming Nepal elections, but those who made the decisions are yet to give in their answers. Many feel that a lot of mistakes have been made which can now only be corrected by the voters who will need to use their wisdom more than ever when voting in the upcoming elections.

Reviewing federalism in Nepal in the context of Madhesh,"“It is too early to judge whether the federalism in Nepal has been successful or not;” the sentence is often used as an exemption whenever asked about the effectiveness of the current structure of polity. But, since, the nation is on the verge to conduct the next federal and provincial elections, the time has come to judge the federal model at least with its initial reports in Madhesh. The inception of federalism in Nepal After the  fall of the monarchy , the imagination of Nepal as a federal democratic republic was understood as a panacea for all racial, cultural, representational and administrative ills. Madhesh, through numerous efforts, raised the demand for federalism in Nepal to institutionalise its political identity, suppressed for a long in a unified regime.  Federalism in Nepal continued to be the core agenda of the comprehensive peace accord between the government and the insurgents (Maoists). But, time and again, the issue was ignored, which caused the trust deficit of Madhesh in mainstream politics. It raised frustration and resulted in a series of protests in the region. Finally, after an amendment to article 138(a) of  the constitution , federalism in Nepal was guaranteed. It resulted in the adoption of the federal model of governance in the constitution, paving the way for self-autonomy and better governmental outcomes.  The impact The exercise of federalism erased the political apathy of the Madheshi populace towards participation in governance. The experience of being elected as an office-holder in their respective ward as well as municipalities and promoting the responsible mode of governance and administration is quite new for a community that mostly remained unheard and excluded since time immemorial. Ease of getting service is one of the major changes brought about by federalism in Nepal. This has not only saved the time, effort and money of the common people but also has consolidated the slogan of “ ” through which the notion of federalism was branded across the country.  Revival of representation at the local level has also shown a multiplier effect on accommodating diverse cultural, caste and gender-based demography at all levels of decision-making since there is now a secured and reserved seat for one Dalit woman out of five persons elected in each ward. Madhesh as a province  of the federal democratic republic of Nepal seems to be well aware of the distinction between federal, quasi-federal, and decentralised governments. That is why it shows its reluctance to be treated as a developmental unit of Kathmandu. For the provincial government, this reluctance is quite justifiable since the crux of federalism is to grant a set of powers to the provinces against the centre.  The constitution, being a source of division of power, grants some impregnable autonomy in certain sectors. The Madhesh province has dragged the federal government into the apex court in numerous episodes as the central government has constantly breached its jurisdiction. For example, the 6th schedule of the Constitution of Nepal clearly mentions that the power to manage the national forest, water usage and environmental management within a province shall rest with the province whereas the 7th schedule talks about the concurrent powers. However, the central government has continuously been involved in digging deep tube wells and other small groundwater projects which are supposed to be done by the province itself. The legal battle continued in  the case of the Sagarnath Forestry Development Project . The federal government was trying to merge the SFDP into the Timber Corporation of Nepal by expanding it as a corporation. The provincial government took the matter to the court. The relief was sought on the basis of schedule 6(19) of the constitution which disallows the federal government to take over any forest of the provincial government. The constitutional bench of the court issued a show cause notice and maintained a temporary   by ordering the federal government not to act upon the matter till the next date.  What next? Madhesh has its grievances over several other conducts of the central government regarding the implementation of federalism in Nepal, leading to legal battles over power-sharing issues like  police adjustment , transfer of district forest officers, and confinement of the chief attorney’s office only within civil and writ jurisdictions. The Madhesh province is subjected to high expectations to implement federalism in Nepal as compared to other provinces since federalism is one of the very few achievements that Madhesh has got through numerous movements, facing violence, unrest, extra-judicial killings and whatnot. Therefore, Madhesh itself sees this as an opportunity it had been seeking for years.  There are visible changes. Firstly, the government was seen far more stable in comparison with the other six provinces. Necessary legislation has been made on a plethora of issues such as the Dalit Empowerment Act. Women are provided with 50 per cent of reservation in employment opportunities.  There is enthusiasm and hope in Madhesh for federalism in Nepal. Of course, there are shortcomings but they shall hopefully be minimised in the long march of practising federalism.",political

"Interest groups run Nepal’s parliament, and it’s jeopardising democracy","Whose voice is heard in Nepal’s parliament? Is it people or political parties? Or is it the various interest groups?  If you as a nation cannot answer these questions, you will have failed democracy.  If you analyse some events that the House of Representatives witnessed in the recently expired term (2017-2022), you may conclude it is the interest groups that are decisive in the legislative process and it is jeopardising democracy.  Here are some key cases. No syndicating means yes syndicating When the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party was in power, the government  tried to end the transport entrepreneurs’ syndicates . But, its  efforts were in vain  and that mostly happened due to the interest groups’ influence on the parliament. How? After the government opened the doors for the transport committees to register as companies, the syndicates did not have much to do. But, thanks to the weak legislation, they changed into companies — their registration shifted from the Associations Registration Act to the Companies Act, but nothing changed.  A Bill to Amend Some Nepal Acts, 2018’s section 81 was mostly in favour of the transport entrepreneurs, giving them the liberty to easily convert their transport committees into companies. This derailed the government’s plan to end syndicates.  The big Yeti The parliament was also used to give private companies, a major interest group, the land owned by the  Nepal Trust . The Nepal Trust Act, 2008, was amended to make sure the lease for the land where Gokarna Resort is located was extended for a further 25 years even before the current lease was due to end. This benefited Yeti Group quite conveniently. The act was amended in a way that the prime minister could appoint anyone to head the trust. Prior to the amendment, the trust was always led by the home minister. Along with that, the prime minister could also appoint the members of the committee which was not the case before. This means those who were close to the Yeti Group became a part of the trust. Ishwar Pokharel led the trust and under him were Yonjom Sherpa, Parvin Raj Dahal and Sitiram Sapkotra as its members. All of them were close to Yeti Group, which meant that even before the lease was coming to an end, they paved the way for Yeti Group to continue operating Gokarna Resort at the property. This was clear that this was the role of interest groups and despite knowing about the situation of the property, the government not being able to do anything shows how weak they are, says National Assembly member Ramesh Jung Rayamajhi. “The way the property was given is wrong. I want to tell the government that I am willing to pay Rs 500 million more for the property. Will they give it to me? No, it won’t because a lot of irregularities have happened in his case,” he said in the National Assembly. The nationalism card The Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act, 2019, which was authenticated on March 27, 2019, was said to have been brought to ease the lives of Nepali farmers, mainly those in the dairy business. But, it only looked out for the businesses involved in the trade.  The bill stopped Amul, an Indian dairy company, from entering Nepal as Nepali businesses felt they would suffer if such a big brand entered Nepal. Nepali dairy owners constantly  lobbied to ensure  that Amul would not be allowed to enter Nepal. But, due to this, the farmers have suffered as they have not been getting a good price for the milk they produce. Consumers are also facing issues as they also have not been getting good quality products. But, using the nationalism card, the interest groups made sure that they killed their competition even before it entered Nepal. Consumer activist  Jyoti Baniya says  things like these are common in Nepal where interest groups have been found amending acts, giving fuel to the nationalism talks. This, he feels, has affected the consumers in the country.  “There are so many examples where interest groups have altered and amended Nepal’s acts. We need to change this attitude,” says Baniya.  He says the last five years have seen a lot of these cases. Nepal’s lawmakers made a lot of acts, but some of them were bought by businesspersons in the country. “I feel this term of the parliament has sold a lot of acts or some section of the act. Why? For the personal gain of a few people. I’ve even been told that even some committees were bought to ensure that what the businesspersons of interests groups wanted to happen,” says Baniya. Beyond the border There were also international interest groups that forced the country to change some acts. One of them was the Ship Registration Act, 1971 which was amended recently to add provisions related to piracy. People were shocked when that happened as since the act came into existence, the country has bought no ship. So why was it necessary? Lawmakers say the reason it was amended was the pressure from the  Financial Action Task Force  (FATF), of which Nepal is a part of.  The amendment of the act was unnecessary, but it was still amended and most Nepalis do not know many acts like these. Interest groups within parliament An example of interest groups changing acts according to their will is the Bank and Financial Institution Act, 2017. The bill was brought by the then finance minister Bishnu Paudel. But, the bill was changed in such a way by key players that it became an act to make things easier for them. Even the Finance Committee of the parliament passed the bill.  How? Well, most members of the Finance Committee of the parliament were bank operators. They showed active participation and, in the end, made sure the act became what they wanted it to be.  The government wanted to set a two-term limit on the chairpersons and CEOs of the banks as it felt that governance would be affected if a person stayed in the position for a long time. But, bankers did not buy that and made sure that the chairpersons could stay in office for as long as they wanted. The lawmakers present in the committee could do nothing. A source from the committee said that most of them could say nothing as most of the bankers-cum-lawmakers were close to senior leaders of the parties. When the party orders them to assist these people, other lawmakers cannot do much. Lawmakers, after they are elected, are given a choice to choose the parliamentary committee they want to be in. This, many argue, helps the interest groups as they can ask lawmakers to whom they are close to select the committees. Even though Nepal’s constitution states lawmakers need to be impartial, this is rarely monitored. — The poor state of infrastructure development in the country, particularly roads and bridges, is a good example of how the parliamentary committees rarely take action against those responsible for delays in these projects. Nepali Congress lawmaker Jip Tsering Lama was a part of the Development Committee for a long time. Lama is the owner of Lama Construction and was even seen going to monitor projects being carried out by his company. Lama’s company is currently working on the Kathmandu-Tarai Fastrack. As his company is involved, lawfully, it was wrong for him to be a part of committee meetings regarding the project. But, he stayed there. Another Nepali Congress lawmaker, Bahadur Singh Lama, who owns Himdung and Thokar Construction, was also a part of the Development Committee. Sources say that he often got angry when people spoke ill about contractors and other similar interest groups. On August 1, 2021, an official from the Department of Roads informed the committee how a bridge being built on the Trishuli was blown away by the wind. Many laughed, but this is no joke as the official was trying to highlight the poor work done by the construction company.  But, this did not go down well with Lama, who said things like these happen and lawmakers or officials did not understand the technicalities of building bridges. The bridge was being built by fellow lawmaker Jip Tsering’s company. Janata Samajbadi Party’s lawmaker Hari Narayan Rauniyar, also a member of the same committee, was accused of corruption and was suspended. Rauniyar is the owner of the infamous Pappu Construction which has been delaying the construction of multiple projects in the country. He often blamed the government for the delay in these construction projects. — After getting elected through the  proportional representation system , Umesh Shrestha choose the Education and Health Committee of the parliament.  A subcommittee under his stewardship prepared a report on how Nepal’s Integrated Education Act should be in the future. Using that, the Education Ministry has drafted the Integrated Education Bill, which is currently in the cabinet. But, Shrestha’s presence in the committee was seen wrongfully as many people say it was  a conflict of interest  given he is a part of the management team at Little Angles School and other schools, and he hence represents the interest group of education businessholders. Their concerns are valid too as he has time and again spoken in support of private educational institutions in the country.  — Foreign employment agency operator, Lal Prasad Sawa Limbu was a part of the Industry, Finance, Labour and Consumer Rights Committee. Businessperson Krishna Kumar Shrestha also chose the same committee.  Bhumi Prasad Tripathi who has invested in a crusher plant chose the Agriculture, Cooperative and Natural Resource Committee. He used his influence to help his nephew who owns a crusher mill in Dhading. He too has investments in the mill.  What was shocking was even people who were tied with corruption cases were a part of the Public Accounts Committee. CPN-UML’s Gokul Baskota, who was  accused of asking for a bribe of Rs 700 million  in a printing press scandal was in the same committee. Accountability in question This mainly happened due to lawmakers forgetting they are accountable to the public, not interest groups, says former speaker Taranath Ranabhat. He says many lawmakers now have a conflict of interest too. “Lawmakers now think about them first. They want to form connections that help them in the future, and that is wrong,” says Ranabhat. Former judge Gauri Bahadur Karki says interest groups have not only reached the parliament but have also reached the higher government officials and political parties. He says the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority not being able to investive some cases is a result of that. “We can’t even file a case against decisions made by the cabinet. This is due to the influence of various interest groups,” says Karki. He feels that currently, all political parties are dependent on some interest groups and are acting on their behalf rather than doing what is right for the country. “Interest groups have bought everyone. These interest groups are Nepal’s mafias. Whicher government comes to power, they buy everyone, but the decision that is made in their favour ears them billion of rupees,” says Karki.  This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

But, he was not helped by other locals who told how they were having to face so many issues despite the village being home to the prime minister of the country. The helipad was the last of their concerns. Development awaited for long Out of all nine districts in the Sudurpaschim, Dadeldhura is the only one without an airport, so a helipad is important. But it is quite embarrassing that Nepali Congress leaders in the area still have not been able to build a helipad given Deuba has  become prime minister five times . The reason a helipad has been in talks is to do with the coming elections, in which Deuba will vie to represent the only constituency in the Dadeldhura district. When Deuba flew to Asigram during the local elections, there was a major issue regarding where to park his helicopter. “The locals didn’t let him land it in the fields,” says a local. Everyone knows why Nepali Congress leaders want to make a helipad. But, others feel that they could have done a lot more. “If they wanted to help the locals, they could have built roads that would mean we could travel easily when we were ill. So many people die as they don’t get proper treatment,” says a 62-year-old. And, he is right. There is no proper road that joins  Ganyapdhura , the local government of Asigram, to the Dadeldhura district headquarters. The road time and again gets damaged by floods, making commuting very difficult. The state of the road has not only restricted the people from getting basic service, but it has also embarrassed the locals with constant questions about why the road leading to the prime minister’s home is so bad. “The distance is so short, yet the state of the road is so bad. It’s very embarrassing,” says a local, Padal Dipal. Deuba comes to his village to cast his vote on a helicopter because of the state of the road. All the blame cannot be put on Deuba though. Nepali Congress BP’s Karna Malla and CPN-Unified Socialists’ Tara Joshi are also from the same area in Dadeldhura. But, the two have not done enough to better the living standard of the people starting with the road. “Because the road is so bad, buses don’t want to come and those that do charge a lot,” says Sete Damai, who says they have to pay Rs 350 to get to the headquarters. For most of the locals, the main problem in the area that needs solving is not a helipad but the road. Poor road access has also affected the area’s human development index. Sorrows galore It is evident that Deuba has not done enough to change the face of his Dadeldhura constituency. But that does not mean he does not love the place. People also seem to love him too as he is  yet to lose an election . Each time he wins, Asigram as well as entire Dadeldhura celebrates like there is no tomorrow. “When he wins, we feel proud. Everyone knows he’s from Asigram and that is something to be very proud of,” says Deuba’s neighbour Padam Dipal. Deuba though has not even taken care of his house in the village. It is currently in ruins as the Maoists demolished it in 2002. Following that, Deuba has not even bothered to rebuild it. “He came in 1994 after that hasn’t been,” says Dipal. Anyone who comes to Asigram to see where Deuba lived in his early childhood only gets to see the remains of his home. Those who come to Dadeldhura to see Deuba’s childhood home get to also witness the pain of the locals. “Where do we hide away the pain? I’m building a house after I took a loan. My elder son is in India to work so we can pay off the loan,” says 55-year-old Laxman Bahadur Rawat. Rawat’s home was damaged by a landslide that happened around two years ago. He was hoping people would help, but no one did and has resorted to taking a loan to rebuild it. He was hoping Deuba would help as he used to go there as a child a lot, but no help came as most of their family members are in India to work. A lot of families from Asigram have people working in India. A lack of opportunities in the area means the only way to earn money is to travel to India. Floods and landslides over the past few years have been harsh as five settlements in the area need to be relocated entirely, says Sarki. “We’ve told Bhanu Deuba (Deuba’s personal secretary) and are waiting for what can be done,” says Sarki. Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand had visited Dadeldhura too and had said the government would help those who lost their homes to natural disasters. But, the locals are yet to receive government support as most believe all the top leaders want from them are votes. But, Indra Bahadur Deuba, 64, blames the local leaders in Dadeldhura and not Sher Bahadur. “Local leaders here aren’t doing enough to make the place better. They need to act like leaders and help develop this place,” says Indra Bahadur. Apart from a motorable road, Asigram also does not have proper health facility. Locals usually have to go to the district headquarters in Khalanga or India for health care. High education is another issue. The locals face the same issue Sher Bahadur Deuba did when he was growing up: leave the village and migrate to cities or abroad.  Challenges for Deuba Many believe that Sher Bahadur Deuba, for the frist time, risks losing the election in Dadeldhura this time. As he has not been able to better the lives of the locals in area, there are talks that he might not get the votes to win. The local elections are a good example of that. Previously, the area had no party apart from Nepali Congress, but now other parties can also been seen in Asigram and Ganyapdhura. Maoists, who burnt down Deuba’s house clean, did a clean sweep in Asigram during the local elections. Even though Nepali Congress won the rural municipality, but Ganyapdhura’s ward 1 that houses Deuba’s home was won by Nepali Congree BP so there is enough evidence that Dadeldhura might no longer be Deuba’s stronghold as it once was.

Gyanendra Shah uses early Dashain greetings to share people’s frustration with parties,"Kathmandu, September 30 Five days ahead of  Bijaya Dashami (Dashain Tika) , former king Gyanendra Shah issued his Dashain greetings video that is more than a statement about people’s frustrations with political parties than festive greetings. Shah’s aide  Phani Raj Pathak posted the video  on his Facebook page on Friday morning, in which the former monarch read a strong-worded written statement that describes how the parties have failed to live up to people’s expectations despite them leading the  abolition of monarchy  in the country one and a half decades ago. Once again, Shah reiterated that Nepal’s nationality is at stake now and the country now needs a strong pillar to hold it.

Bibeksheel Sajha prepares to welcome Milan Pandey after Rabindra Mishra’s exit,"Kathmandu, September 29 Bibeksheel Sajha Party is preparing to welcome back its former coordinator Milan Pandey after the party chairman Rabindra  Mishra left the party  to  join the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party . The majority faction of the party led by  Mishra removed Pandey  and his supporters from the party in December 2021. Before that, Pandey and his team had  floated a new political document  to  oppose Rabindra Mishra ‘s Nation above the Notion document that  proposed the abolition of federalism  and a referendum on secularism. But, with  Mishra advancing  his controversial Nation above Notion idea to demand the reinstatement of a constitutional monarchy and the Hindu(-Buddhist) state, and the abolition of federalism in the country, and ultimately joining the royalist party, Bibeksheel Sajha has launched efforts to reunite Milan Pandey.

It means he will not fight for the parliamentary berth during the  House of Representatives elections to be held on November 20 .  Recently, he has been telling his aides that he would now focus on party organisation and ideology construction instead of electoral politics. “He says people reaching the age of 70 years soon need to leave the place for the new generation and they need to help the new people politically and ideologically,” a leader close to Bhattarai says.  Apparently, Bhattarai is  preparing to unify his party  with the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led CPN-Maoist Centre after the November elections. According to a Maoist leader, the two leaders have agreed that Dahal will lead state affairs and power politics from the party whereas Bhattarai will lead it ideologically.",political
Rabindra Mishra joins Rastriya Prajatantra Party as senior vice-chairperson,"Kathmandu, September 28 Two days after  resigning from the Bibeksheel Sajha Party  that he had established,  journalist-turned-politician Rabindra Mishra  joined the Rastriya Prajatantra Party as its senior vice-chairperson. RPP Chairperson Rajendra Lingden welcomed him amidst a special function organised in Kathmandu on Wednesday. The ceremony has been named the unification function between the RPP and Mishra-led ‘wide polarisation advocates’ as some other Bibeksheel Sajha leaders are also joining the RPP. The full list of former Bibeksheel Sajha leaders following Mishra, however, has not been made public yet. The two sides have signed a four-point agreement, according to which the new entrants will be inducted into the RPP committees at all levels. — Rabindra Mishra  submitted his resignation  from the general membership of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party to the party chairperson and  his successor Samikchya Baskota  on Monday. On the same day, he central committee meeting of the Rajendra Lingden-led RPP also decided on Monday to induct Mishra as the senior vice-chairperson of the party.  In the resignation letter that he submitted, Mishra said he was leaving the party as political polarisation was needed in the country and he was on a mission to form a moderate conservative nationalist force. The founder of the Sajha Party  announced his resignation  from the top position of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party after its poor performance in the local elections in May. Even after that, he was still a member of the party despite carrying out political activities individually. In July,  Mishra advanced  his controversial  Nation above Notion  idea to demand the reinstatement of a constitutional monarchy and the Hindu(-Buddhist) state, and the abolition of federalism in the country.

Supreme Court tells the president to give reasons for rejecting the citizenship bill,"Kathmandu, September 25 The Supreme Court has issued a show-cause notice in the name of the President’s Office, asking for reasons why President Bidya Devi Bhandari did not authenticate the controversial citizenship bill on time. A single bench of Justice Hari Phuyal issued the order in response to five writ petitions against the president that argued her decision to not approve the bill was against the constitution.  Endorsing the bill to amend the Citizenship Act through both houses of the federal parliament, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota  sent the bill to the head of the state  seeking its final assent on September 5.  As per the constitution, the head of the state was required to approve the citizenship bill sent to her for the second time within 15 days of her office receiving it. However, she did not do so by September 20. Article 113(4) of the constitution  reads: “In case any bill is sent back along with a message by the president, and both houses reconsider and adopt the bill as it was or with amendments and present it again, the president shall authenticate that bill within fifteen days of such presentation.” — The  second amendment to the Citizenship Act  was aimed at addressing concerns of the Madhesh-centric parties and the Non-resident Nepali Association. However, it was drawn into controversy citing the citizenship bill did not bar foreign women marrying Nepali men from getting citizenship easily. Self-claimed nationalist activists have expressed concerns that loose citizenship provisions in Nepal could give the dominating India to gradually push its citizens to Nepal and perpetuate its control over the small county. Consequently, President Bidya Devi Bhandari  returned the citizenship bill  to the parliament, suggesting a reconsideration, bringing herself into a conflict with the executive. Both houses, however, approved the bill  as it was and sent it to the president.",political

"Proportional representation parliamentary seats, meant for the marginalised, are being captured by the powerful in Nepal","While the country was celebrating Constitution Day earlier this week, political parties submitted their closed list of the proportional representation candidates for the  November elections  of the House of Representatives and provincial assemblies to the  Election Commission Nepal .  The goal behind the implementation of the proportional representation electoral system was to reduce the long-standing inequality based on regions, communities, genders, classes, etc, and to guarantee inclusive representation in the legislature. But, looking at the list, it can be said that the parties have prioritised the leaders who already have political access to resources.  In other words, the parties that competed to express commitment to implement the constitution ironically did the opposite and prepared a non-inclusive list. Hence, serious questions have once again been raised about the commitment and honesty of the parties towards the constitution. “The political leadership should have thought about the spirit and intention of the proportional representation electoral system. But, if they just want to exploit the loopholes and serve those who are members of parliaments and ministers in the proportional representation quota, we can just follow one system (first-past-the-post or proportional),” comments Bipin Adhikari, a senior constitutional expert and policy analyst. Adhikari adds that the leaders of major parties that have contested direct elections and keep losing are misusing the proportional representation system.  Capture by the powerful The CPN-Maoist Centre, which claims to have proportional inclusion as its agenda, has prioritised Krishna Bahadur Mahara who already has won multiple elections and enjoys parliamentary and political benefits. He won elections from Rolpa-2 in 1991, Dang-3 in 2007, Rolpa-1 in 2013 and Dang-2 in 2017.  The party championed Mahara even though he  had to resign  as the speaker after facing allegations of sexual violence. Mahara is also currently the vice-chairperson of the Maoist Centre.  He says. “I fought directly five times and won, so I asked them to put me in the proportional representation system this time.” Nepali Congress shares the same case. From Gopal Man Shrestha, who has been the acting chief (of the Nepali Congress Democratic party) to Bimalendra Nidhi, who has claimed the leadership of the party, are also giving their candidacy under the proportional representation system. Nidhi, who carries the family legacy of Congress founder Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, won the 2008 elections from Dhanusha.  Congress joint general secretaries Jeevan Pariyar and Farmullah Mansur are also on the proportional representation candidacy list. Both are leaders in national politics.  What more? They have also kept  Arzu Rana Deuba , who might be the successor of the party leadership, on the list. Deuba, who contested in the 2017 election from Kailali-5, was still recommended from the same constituency. Another strong example of that is Prem Bahadur Singh. Singh, who entered the UML last March by sharing the same platform together with actress  Karishma Manandhar , is also on the list. Singh had already formed a separate party and became MP and won elections under the proportional representation system in 2007 and 2013. Nainkala Thapa is another name on the UML’s list. On June 10 last year, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli appointed Thapa as the minister for communications (though only for two weeks) whereas she is the wife of UML Vice-Chairman Ram Bahadur Thapa. CPN-Unified Socialist  has also placed its leaders, who have a stronghold, on the proportional representation candidate list. Vice-chairman Pramesh Hamal, deputy general secretary Gangalal Tuladhar and secretary Nagendra Chaudhary are on the list. All these three are leaders who have good influence within the party and even in national politics. The infamous trend This trend of listing political leaders, who can and have won direct elections, in the proportional representation candidate list started with Girija Prasad Koirala. In the 2007 elections, the then Prime Minister and Nepali Congress President Koirala sat at the top of the list. Given Koirala’s age or seniority and previous roles (interim prime minister and head of state), no one from the party opposed it either. Meanwhile, protests broke out because the parties started including rich people with controversial backgrounds on the proportional representation candidate list. But, the parties did not make any corrections and the trend continued.  Parties have assigned ministerial and advisory responsibilities to rich and influential leaders who came with the benefit of the proportional representation electoral system. Constitutional expert Bipin Adhikari says the system adopted by the parties now does not allow the participation of marginalised communities, castes, genders and regions, going against the purpose of the system altogether. A suitable example of this is the current Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand. Khand has been a central member of Congress since 1996 and a strong contender for the leadership of the party. But, he too used the quota to get into the parliament in 2017.  The trend also shows that those without political background or merit have become ministers through the proportional representation system. Moti Lal Dugar , who held the position of special economic advisor to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, became an MP from the proportional representation in the 2017 elections. Not only did Oli make him the MP from the Madheshi cluster but he also appointed him as the state minister for industry. Earlier, in 2007, the UML also made billionaire Binod Chaudhary a member of parliament under the proportional representation system. It was the same case with Lharkyal Lama. Lama even became the state minister for finance when Jhala Nath Khanal was the prime minister. But, Chaudhary and Lama did not stay long in the UML.  Although the leaders speak in favour of the trend of appointing people from the business background, the perception of it has always been negative. It is a popular thought that they have “bought their way to party and parliament”. This trend is still in order in the current government. Prime Minister Deuba drew heavy criticism when he  appointed Umesh Shrestha , a member of parliament under the proportional representation system, as the state minister for health in July last year.

Constitution of Nepal turns 7. Here are 7 key attacks it survived from people fighting for it,"With President Bidya Devi Bhandari refusing to authenticate the controversial citizenship bill as mandated by the 2015 constitution of Nepal, there are  many questions about her role . Some experts and stakeholders have commented that it was an attack on the constitution. But, President Bhandari is not alone as there have been several such incidents in the past also.  When Nepal drafted the new  Constitution of Nepal in 2015 , almost all political parties were on the same page. Seven years on, all these parties have gone in different directions. The parties never worked together. Neither did their ideologies match. What is even worse is that the parties did not even try to compete with integrity. In the past seven years, these very people have belittled the constitution of Nepal and attacked it. Even the stakeholders know this as they have not followed what is written in the constitution for their political gain.  Today, on the occasion of the seventh Constitution Day that Nepal marked on September 19, 2022, we look at seven ways in which the constitution of Nepal has been attacked, belittled and abused by those in power. 1. Dissolution of the House On December 20, 2020, when then Prime Minister KP Sharma  Oli dissolved the House of Representatives , even people from his own party were shocked as there was no provision to do so in the 2015 constitution of Nepal. After his first attempts failed, Oli  dissolved the House yet again the next year , leading to  his downfall in the end . Why did he do so? The answer was simple to stay in power. The erstwhile NCP was in turmoil and it was almost certain that Oli would not have a majority if the party voted for its next leader. To ensure that did not happen and he did not lose his position as the chair, he dissolved the House calling for early elections. His move was supported by the president too. People moved to court calling the move unconstitutional. The Supreme Court voided the decision by Oli calling it an attack on the constitution of Nepal and  reinstated the House second time in six months. 2. Issues with inclusiveness The constitution of Nepal is based on inclusivity. The constitution has clearly stated that all government bodies and mechanisms should be inclusive. But, when it comes to appointing officials or electing them, the principle of inclusivity has not been followed. Every time there is an election, the parties that claim to be inclusive never follow their manifesto or principles. Female ministers are a rarity. Even in the House, there is no inclusivity. The local level has also not been able to have people from all communities which is a major cause for concern. The case is similar when it comes to appointing people to constitutional bodies. Even the  National Inclusion Commission  has never been inclusive and a few weeks ago, it even suggested the government remove the reservation practice. The judiciary, which forces people to follow the constitution of Nepal, does not follow what is written in it. The courts have a major issue with inclusivity when it comes to the appointment of judges. When Prakash Nepali and a few others filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court, asking for inclusiveness during the appointment of judges, the court said the judiciary cannot look at inclusivity as it prioritises competence when hiring judges. Justices Tej Bahadur KC and Bam Kumar Shrestha said that if the court focused on inclusiveness, the system would suffer. Due to this thought process, the Supreme Court only has two female justices. One other has been recommended, but when she will be appointed remains to be seen. “The presence of people marginalised communities [in state affairs] is increasing. And, we should take this positively,” says Rekha Sharma, a member of the State Affairs Committee of the recently expired House of Representatives. “But, yes, a lot of government bodies don’t follow the principle of inclusiveness and that needs to improve in the long run.” 3. Foundation-shaking ordinances When the House is on a break, there might come a time when the ruling government has to come up with new legal provisions. With this in mind, the constitution of Nepal has the provision for ordinances. The ordinance can last only six months, after which it will have to be endorsed by the House in the following session.  But, over the past few years, the government prorogues the parliament and issues ordinances whenever it feels it cannot face the house with the proposed law. It happens because the propositions are based not on necessity but on their power interests. Consider the ordinances to amend key political laws such as the  Constitutional Council Act , the  Act on Political Parties  and the  Citizenship Act . Not only KP Sharma Oli, but Sher Bahadur Deuba has also done the same.  “Was there a need for these ordinances? I don’t think so,” says advocate Raju Prasad Chapagain. “These were done to bring something in a swift manner as they were afraid that others will oppose.” 4. Weak federalism The governments that came to power following the promulgation of the new federal constitution of Nepal have never been a fan of federalism. None of them has been able to develop both the local and provincial levels of the government. They have not been able to balance the workforce at either the local or the provincial level. Outgoing parliamentarian Rekha Sharma says that due to disputes between different levels of the government, they have not been able to implement the laws properly. Even the laws mentioned in the constitution of Nepal have not been implemented, questioning if federalism really works in the country. Sharma says this is the reason why the draft of the federal civil service bill has not been presented to the House of Representatives. “Dispute among government officials is a reason why the bill hasn’t been able to move forward,” she says. With no federal laws, it has been impossible to efficiently manage federalism in the country. Even fundamental rights have not been implemented well.  5. Citizenship issues The constitution of Nepal states that no Nepali citizen is barred from obtaining a citizenship certificate. But, in the past seven years, this has been limited to paper alone. Even though one whole  term of the House of Representatives has been over , there still has  not been a consensus  when it comes to a bill to amend the Citizenship Act. The bill was passed by both houses despite objections from the CPN-UML. The constitution of Nepal states that anyone whose father and mother were Nepalis would get citizenship by descent. But, since there are no laws for children born to citizens by birth, a lot of people have not been able to get their citizenship. “There are people who have registered writ petitions at the Supreme Court. They got their citizenship, but others still wait for what will be their fate,” says senior advocate Mira Dhungana. She says politicians are playing politics with the future of people and it is wrong. “How fair is it that these people have to fight for their constitutional rights,” she questions. 6. Constitutional bodies becoming job hubs For the purpose of checks and balances, the constitution of Nepal has envisioned various constitutional bodies. These bodies include the Election Commission to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. But, people are not appointed fairly in these bodies. Over the course of history, these bodies have become places where those in power send their aides or cadres. This means these bodies have not been able to work efficiently to implement the constitution of Nepal. There was a time even  Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana asked for a share  to send his person to the cabinet. PM Oli once brought the Constitutional Council Ordinances and  appointed 52 officials as he pleased .  7. Lack of a fair jurisprudential practice  They say interpretation gives life to a constitution. But, the Supreme Court which is there to interpret the constitution of Nepal in the correct manner has time again failed it. Different cases related to the constitution are still at the Supreme Court. When will they be heard is anyone’s guess. Cases like the jurisdiction of the federal, local and provincial governments and election issues are still at the court awaiting a date for hearing. It has also not been able to publish the full text of the verdicts on some of the settled cases. The constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, established as mandated by the constitution of Nepal, has been seen as useless in recent times. The bench has not been holding regular meetings and even when it does, it has not been able to act fast questioning its existence. The cases filed questioning the results of the 2017 elections have not been solved even as the term of the lawmakers has ended. How the court has not been able to prioritise it has been quite shocking to all as it is most likely that these cases will be heard only after the  next elections in November .

A lot of questions about the president’s role as she refuses to enact the citizenship bill,"Kathmandu, September 21 President Bidya Devi Bhandari has refused to enact the controversial citizenship bill sent to her for final assent by both houses of the parliament.  The constitution required her to enact the bill by Tuesday midnight, the 15th day since Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota sent the bill for approval. However, the President’s Office remained silent about the bill during this period. The government had apparently expected the head of the state would approve the bill on the final day, but the ruling party leaders say they were shocked by the president’s move. Senior Nepali Congress leader  Ram Chandra Paudel says  the president’s move has jeopardised the constitution. Advocate Sunil Kumar Pokharel says the president did not have any alternative to approving the bill sent to her for the second time. “Otherwise, she should resign. Not approving the bill as mandated by the constitution but still retaining the position is a breach of the constitution.” Nepal Bar Association President Gopal Krishna Ghimire says this is an example of the misuse of the taxpayers’ money.  Endorsing the bill to amend the Citizenship Act through both houses of the federal parliament, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota  sent the bill to the head of the state  seeking its final assent two weeks ago.  Article 113(4) of the constitution  reads: “In case any bill is sent back along with a message by the president, and both houses reconsider and adopt the bill as it was or with amendments and present it again, the president shall authenticate that bill within fifteen days of such presentation.” — The  second amendment to the Citizenship Act  was aimed at addressing concerns of the Madhesh-centric parties and the Non-resident Nepali Association. However, it was drawn into controversy citing the citizenship bill did not bar foreign women marrying Nepali men from getting citizenship easily. Self-claimed nationalist activists have expressed concerns that loose citizenship provisions in Nepal could give the dominating India to gradually push its citizens to Nepal and perpetuate its control over the small county. Consequently, President Bidya Devi Bhandari  returned the citizenship bill  to the parliament, suggesting a reconsideration, bringing herself into a conflict with the executive. Both houses, however, approved the bill  as it was and sent it to the president.",political
Writ petition demands the president put on hold the citizenship bill,"Kathmandu, September 20 The Supreme Court has registered a writ petition that demands President Bidya Devi Bhandari put on hold the controversial citizenship bill. Endorsing the bill to amend the Citizenship Act through both houses of the federal parliament, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota  sent the bill to the head of the state  seeking its final assent two weeks ago. Today is the 15th day since the bill was sent, and  constitutionally , she is required to enact the bill by the end of today. In this context, senior advocate Surendra Bhandari filed the petition arguing the head of the state should put the bill on hold as it is against the country’s interests.  The petition was listed on the cause list today, but the hearing could not take place.  As President Bidya Devi Bhandari had  sent back the same bill  to the House of Representatives suggesting a revision, which the houses refused to consider, it is not yet clear what the president will do next.

Here’s why Nepal opposition leader KP Sharma Oli is unpopular among indigenous people in his constituency,"Near the dense Geuriya forest of  Kamal rural municipality  ward 5 in southeastern Nepal, there was a burial ground of local indigenous people. After the Armed Police Force settled its battalion on its northern side in 2002, several efforts were made to remove this.  But, the locals were against it as the place was linked to their existence. Back then as well, the locals did not want the police to stay there but due to the insurgency, they were compelled to remain silent. The burial ground of indigenous people started shrinking after police began living there.   In 2009, the then head of the battalion, Ganesh Thada Magar proposed to build a stadium dedicated to the indigenous people on the burial ground. Over a decade down the line, the stadium has become a headache for Nepal’s opposition leader KP Sharma Oli.  Here, we explain why.  The history of Indigenous People’s Stadium Then, stakeholders, family members of the buried individuals, local leaders, and government authorities discussed the proposal through several meetings over four months. Finally, they had an agreement to name the stadium Adivasi Janajati Rangasala (Indigenous People’s Stadium), which would be under the control of indigenous people.   The head of the Damak Area Administration Office, local bureaucrats of Topgachi and Lakhanpur, and representatives of political parties and indigenous people, all signed the agreement.   Afterwards, in the fiscal year 2010/2011, sitting finance minister Surendra Pandey allocated the budget of Rs 10 million for building the stadium. The contract to build the stadium was taken by the APF itself. According to the agreement, 845 bones from the burial site were gathered in one place and a pillar was built there to honour the indigenous people.   But, in the fiscal year 2011/2012, the budget for the stadium was not allocated. Again in the fiscal year 2012/2013, Rs 10.5 million was allocated. With that budget, the works of building parapets and fencing started but could not take complete shape. Until 2014, due to irregularities in budget allocation and work, the Indigenous People’s Stadium did not receive any priority.  The Oli connection But in 2015, after KP Sharma Oli was appointed as the prime minister, the stadium was renamed Madan Bhandari Stadium after the late CPN-UML leader. Afterwards, the budget for the stadium was allocated regularly.  “Although the allocation of budget for the stadium was regular, the development did not address the identity of the local indigenous people. That’s why we posed obstruction,” says Dipen Bala Rai, the general secretary at Indigenous Stadium and Memorial Academy.   Following that, KP Sharma Oli shifted the project to build an indigenous people’s stadium to Damak-3 in his hometown.  Although the stadium is shifted to Oli’s hometown, nothing has been done there. The current government is also ignoring the project.  After the formation of the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government,  the locals even went to Kathmandu, asking to allocate the budget for the stadium. But, the federal government remained indifferent to the stranded Indigenous People’s Stadium.  The costly move In the recently held  local elections , KP Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML could not secure its seats in Kamal rural municipality, a place where the majority of voters are from indigenous communities. The main reason behind it was the stadium project that is in limbo.  “Due to the same issue, Oli can also face tough times in the  upcoming parliamentary elections ,” says Rai. “From changing the name of Phalgunanda Hall of Damak to politicising the Indigenous People’s Stadium, the leadership of CPN-UML has been attacking us.” “It’s a humiliation against our ancestors,” he adds.  Meanwhile, the UML claims that the name of the stadium was changed with the consent of locals, but later, Nepali Congress politicised the issue.  “After the continuous protest, party chairman Oli convinced everyone regarding renaming the stadium and building another Indigenous People’s Museum on 6.69 acres of land,” says Hom Bahadur Thapa, a UML leader.  According to him, the Nepali Congress made the matter political agenda after finding some indigenous communities against the stadium.  With an expectation to get financial aid from a donor agency, the stadium was renamed after Madan Bhandari, he says.  But, Rai is not satisfied with this argument.  “If naming the stadium after Madan Bhandari can garner financial support, why can’t it happen with the name Indigenous People’s Stadium? It clearly shows that they are not with the indigenous community,” says Rai.  Even many local leaders of that UML accept that their party has been unable to understand the sentiments of the public.  “We even had a neutral name. If the stadium was renamed Madan Bhandari Indigenous People’s Stadium, things would have been different,” says one leader of the CPN-UML.

Election Commission: Parties have to field women for at least 33% of the FPTP candidates,"Kathmandu, September 18 The  Election Commission  says parties have to field women for at least 33 per cent of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) positions during the  November 20 elections  of the House of Representatives and national assemblies. The laws have it that at least 33 per cent of the members of the House of Representatives and provincial assemblies shall be women, but there is no legal requirement about the share of women candidates. But, the commission decided to direct the parties to ensure that at least 33 per cent of their candidates under the direct election system are women. Under the proportional representation (PR) election system, there is a 50 per cent reservation for women in each category. The Election Commission says it made the decision considering sentiments of articles 38(4), 42 and 47 of  the constitution  as well as a similar directive of the National Concern and Coordination Committee of the National Assembly.",political
Govt panel says Nijgadh is the best option for the next international airport,"Kathmandu, September 18 A government-commissioned panel has suggested that Nijgadh is the best option for constructing the next international airport in the country. The panel submitted its report to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on Sunday in the presence of Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister Jeevan Ram Shrestha.  In August, the government formed a team led by Birendra Deuja, a former chief of the  Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal  to come up with a suggestion about the most appropriate place to construct the new international airport. After the  full text of the Supreme Court order  that cancelled the ongoing airport project had come out, the government said it would  restart the plan  and construct the airport there itself. Accordingly, the  experts’ team had been formed . While the panel has stuck to Nijgadh as the best place, it has recommended dropping the idea of an airport city to minimise the environmental risk as told by the Supreme Court.

"A divided panel forwards CJ Rana’s impeachment motion to House, but it will never be put to vote","Kathmandu, September 18 The impeachment recommendation committee in the House of Representatives that is looking into the impeachment motion against suspended Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana submitted its report to Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota on Saturday evening. The panel has decided to recommend Rana’s impeachment on the basis of eight reasons. However, the decision was made on a majority basis in the 11-member committee as five members representing the main opposition CPN-UML and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal dissented from the majority’s decision. They argued the evidence to impeach Rana was not strong enough. Most probably, the motion will not be put to vote in the full house as the  term of the legislative body expired  Saturday midnight. The next house will begin its operation in December following the nationwide  elections on November 20 . Given the slow vote counting in Nepal elections, the new house is unlikely to get formed by December 12, the date when Rana is stipulated to retire. Once that happens, the impeachment motion will be rendered irrelevant.  The House of Representatives in the first week of August  began a detailed discussion  on the impeachment motion against Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Rana after nearly five months of the proposal being registered. It  began recording statements  from him in the last week of August only. The motion was  tabled in the House on March 13 , but it was put on hold as the House session was prorogued. With the prorogued, it was expected that the  motion would not be endorsed, yet he would not return to the office . Earlier, on March 6, the house  formed an impeachment recommendation committee  to study the motion. On February 11, lawmakers of the ruling alliance  filed the impeachment motion  at the Federal Parliament Secretariat demanding the removal of CJ Rana.",political
Has Nepal never been colonised?,"Although we have a list of complaints about Nepal, the country that we live in, we are all proud Nepalis when it comes to the sovereignty of this country. We sing the  bravery of Gorkhali/Gurkha soldiers  and believe that we were never colonised by any other country. We do not celebrate Independence Day, unlike our neighbouring country India, a colonised country. But, what if I say that we also have always been a colonised country? Does your Nepali blood boil? Will you accuse me of being brought up by some European nation and that my opinion is just their idea that they want us to believe in?  Colonialism in Nepal Okay, first, let’s understand what colonisation actually is to know that if we were and are still a colonised country by some foreign powers. In general understanding, colonisation is defined as  control by one power over a dependent area or people . They enforce their values and culture upon us. They largely take our identities and dominate us. They take economic advantage of the colonised country (colony) and work according to the coloniser’s self-interest and profit. Okay, now, let’s do the reality check. We often see a lot of Nepali people, in general, having a  preference for English  to the extent they have adopted the culture of speaking English even at home. We get stunned when someone has good English; we suppose them to be an intelligent person. English has such great power among the general Nepali population. A desire to excel in English is not as serious as it is a gradual forgetting and weakening of our own roots.  This present generation can mostly not even count from one to a hundred in Nepali. We are basically weak in our own language and read mostly foreign writers’ books to improve our vocabulary. This truly shows us being a colonised country partially and through soft power.  Language carries a history, tradition, norms, and values, and it is primarily an identity. However, as today’s youth become less fluent in their language, it has a significant impact on the development of relationships and a sense of community among the people. The English vernacular has not just become a language to communicate but rather an important part of a person’s status. So, are we not a colonised country as far as culture and identity are concerned? Different forms of colonialism Any nation’s sovereignty simply means that it is free of internal and external influences. However, foreign policies have always had a significant impact on our country’s political life. Although the British never actually captured anyone physically, they were smart enough to buy a handful of aristocratic rulers with extensive political influence. At present, there is great political influence from neighbouring sides and other powerful developing countries as well. The colonists seek economic benefit for the colonised country, and with the concept of globalisation, all the money, productive labour, and resources are being exported to foreign lands, leaving the colonised country in poverty. Domestic industries are largely impacted by international companies, and it is truly an unfair competition to survive among these powerful international companies. The culture of any country is its biggest asset. It is a country’s identity and brings all of its citizens together. But, using soft power by foreign nations, we are slowly forgetting the significance of our culture. We have been manipulated to believe that speaking in their accent, copying western dress codes, and eating with a spoon and fork are way more civilised than adopting the Nepali lifestyle. We are heavily influenced by them; we want everything to be like them, and having such a mindset simply elevates them above us, which is the goal of the colonisers in any colonised country. Although Nepal has never been formally colonised, its history and the present show the political influence, cultural assimilation and acculturation, and economic advantage taken from Nepal are similar to those of a colonised country. We can say we have been colonised more in a soft way and if the correct action is not taken at the right time, it can be a very unfortunate thing for this country in the long term.",political

In response to a question of lawmakers in connection with  his impeachment proposal , Rana accepted on Sunday that the 2020 order was not right. Though the Kathmandu District Court had handed down a 20-year jail sentence to Koirala, convicting him of murdering his wife, and the then Appellate Court had upheld it, the  Supreme Court had cut short  the sentence to eight and a half years in response to an appeal filed by the convict. The apex court division bench comprising Chief Justice Cholendra Shamsher Ranan and Justice Tej Bahadur KC had argued that he should be released to take care of his children. The apex court, after Rana’s suspension,  overturned the verdict  in May, making the government jail him again.  “I made a mistake in using my discretion [in the Ranjan Koirala case]. I apologise to the people for this. I regret this decision,” Rana said.  The impeachment committee on Sunday asked five questions to Rana. The next meeting has been called for next Sunday.",political
Chinese Speaker Li Zhanshu’s Nepal visit: What’s on the agenda?,"Kathmandu, September 4 Chinese Speaker  Li Zhanshu  is visiting Nepal on September 12-15 at the invitation of House of Representatives Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota, according to officials. The visit of the chairman of China’s National People’s Congress is yet to be formally announced by either side, but the preparations have reached the final stage, informs an official at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs .  Li Zhanshu is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Nepal after Chinese President  Xi Jinping who was in Nepal  in October 2019.  “The visit is not publicly announced yet as the visit duration and dates are yet to be finalised. But now, it has been fixed that the visit would begin on September 12 and last for four days,” the official says, “It means it will be made public now.” During the visit, Li would hold bilateral meetings with Speaker Sapkota whereas he will also pay courtesy calls on President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.  Whereas several parliament-level delegations visit Nepal on a regular basis, this is the first time that such a Chinese delegation is coming.  It has been learned that Sapkota wanted Li Zhanshu to visit Nepal as soon as  he got elected  to the position, but it has been possible only when the term of the House is being over.",political
President is in a tight spot as both houses endorse the citizenship bill unchanged,"Kathmandu, September 2 President Bidya Devi Bhandari is in a tight spot as both houses of the federal parliament endorsed the citizenship bill unchanged, rejecting  her suggestions for reconsideration . Days after the  House of Representatives endorsed the bill , the National Assembly also approved the controversial document with majority votes on Friday evening. Earlier, the bill was  sent to its Legislation Committee  for a detailed discussion, but it had sent back the bill unchanged. Now, the assembly will send back the bill to the House of Representatives where it originated. Then, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota will certify the bill and send it to the president seeking final assent. But, President Bhandari apparently does not want this as she had sent back the citizenship bill for a revision with a 15-point suggestion. Yet,  constitutionally , she does not have any option but to approve it when a bill is sent to her for the second time. There are speculations that the  president might resign  or seek the Supreme Court’s opinion, but constitutional experts are divided about the availability of such options. The  second amendment to the Citizenship Act  was aimed at addressing concerns of the Madhesh-centric parties and the Non-resident Nepali Association. However, it was drawn into controversy citing the citizenship bill did not bar foreign women marrying Nepali men from getting citizenship easily. Self-claimed nationalist activists have expressed concerns that loose citizenship provisions in Nepal could give the dominating India to gradually push its citizens to Nepal and perpetuate its control over the small county. Consequently, President Bidya Devi Bhandari returned the citizenship bill to the parliament, suggesting a reconsideration, bringing herself into a conflict with the executive.",political
National Assembly to elect thematic committee chairs on Thursday,"Kathmandu, September 2 National Assembly , the upper house of the bicameral parliament, is electing chairpersons of all its thematic committees on coming Thursday (September 8).  The National Assembly Secretariat says the elections have been scheduled as agreed by the parties. The assembly regulations have it that the four thematic committee members are elected every two years as one-third of the assembly members complete their terms in an interval of two years.  One-third of the lawmakers were  elected in January  to assume their positions in March. The elections were due since then.  The National Assembly has 59 members. As it is constituted as a “permanent” body, it is  never fully dissolved . Rather, one-third of the members retire every two years and the next batch gets elected. The newly elected members stay in office for the next six years. The assembly vice-chairperson’s position is also vacant, but the parties are yet to agree on the election to fill this.",political

The provincial cabinet has already decided to end the ongoing parliamentary session on Friday, and there will not be time for the provincial government to call the next session before candidates file nominations for the next elections.

"Nepal parliamentarians prioritise populism than anything else, and it’s costing democracy","On August 18, the House of Representatives, the lower house of Nepal parliament, was on the verge of passing the Citizenship Bill as it is despite President Bidya Devi  Bhandari asking the house to reconsider  some points on it. Lawmakers from the CPN-UML, stating there were some weaknesses in the bill, protested against the passing of the bill. Joining the protest were two lawmakers from the ruling coalition – Parbata DC Chaudhary of the Nepali Congress and Nira Devi Jairu of the CPN-Unified Socialist. Chaudhary asked other lawmakers to think out of the party and speak for the betterment of the country. “Neither we nor our party is bigger than the country. I know, a lot of us think this is wrong but won’t say a word as they fear the party will take action against them, but we have to speak and speak now,” she said in the house. Jairu also added to this and questioned the decision of senior leaders to pass the bill despite it having issues. “Do we know what implications this bill will have on our future? Do the senior leaders understand this?” she questioned. After realising some coalition leaders were also against the bill, the UML lawmakers asked for a vote count. They felt that people would vote against the passing of it, but it did not happen. The  bill was passed  and even lawmakers like Chaudhary and Jairu, who were against the bill, voted in favour of it. This is just one example of Nepal parliamentarians being populist. They, time and again, speak in the parliament to please the general public as snippets of them speaking about an issue can go viral on social media and mass media. They are often heard speaking against their own party, but when it is time to vote, these lawmakers always go in the direction that their party is going, leaving people to think that populism rules supreme in the Nepal parliament. It, ultimately, makes the democratic institution of parliament incredible, fear stakeholders. The pressure of the public Thanks to the country’s open political practice, these types of statements in the Nepal parliament do not go unnoticed. The public is watching and hearing everything that these politicians say. Maybe that is why most political leaders try and say things to be popular with the public. Rather than speaking about policy changes and how they will affect the country, most think about how their statements will be seen by the public and speak accordingly.  On May 1, 2020, as Covid was spreading in Nepal, the Legislation Committee of the National Assembly told the government to increase testing.  A few months later, on August 21, 2020, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives told the government to manage 10,000 ICUs and ventilators immediately along with undertaking PCR tests in all 77 districts.  These decisions at a time when the infection was in full flow were popular. The media too gave these a lot of importance. But, people who knew about the  state of Nepal’s health system  knew these were just talks and that implementing what the parliamentary committees said was impossible. The negative impact of lust for being popular among Nepal parliamentarians can be seen during the drafting of laws and regulations. Take chapter 9 of the House of Representatives Regulations. The regulation states that members of the house can question the prime minister twice a month. But, this has rarely been implemented as Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has not held a question-and-answer session at the House of Representatives even once during this current term that  began in July 2021 . Political science professor Lok Raj Baral says it is wrong for parliamentarians to focus on getting popular rather than focusing on long-term goals to better the country. “All these people do is speak. When it comes to work, they do nothing and that sets bad examples,” says Baral. And he is right. Many members of the Nepal parliament feel they can speak anything they want to become popular. Some say stories; some say poems some even quote songs, but rarely does anyone offer solutions. Even Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa is guilty of popularism as he challenged the people of Nepal to kick him out of Kathmandu if the American Army came to Nepal after the Nepal parliament approved the  Millenium Challenge Corporation  grant. This was unnecessary, say political scientists. To speak or not to speak Lawmaker Bidya Bhattarai feels that a lawmaker should only speak what is relevant. She feels that at the moment, many lawmakers speak what they feel like and even when they talk about something relevant, they do not come up with solutions on how they can change things. “If we continue to do this, people will stop believing us. We need to start implementing what we say and improve the society we live in,” says Bhattarai. She says lawmakers do point out corruption and other issues but never find the cause and offer a solution. “I think we forget this is our job,” says Bhattarai. Baral says populism is affecting both houses of the Nepal parliament as most lawmakers feel that to win elections, they have to be popular. And since they cannot fulfil the promises they give voters, all they can do is speak to get views on social media. He feels that this is happening worldwide as parliaments across the globe are full of nationalist and populist ideas. “People don’t believe in a strong party anymore; they believe in strong and popular people. This mindset and entered Nepal too,” says Baral. “But, a populist leader is mostly an expert in spreading illusion and we’ve seen that in the Nepal parliament too.” CPN-UML leader Yogesh Bhattarai also says that it will take a few years for Nepal parliamentarians to get away from this populist trend. “People don’t believe in political parties. They are upset with us and for that reason, populism will reign supreme for a few more years in Nepal,” he says. Need for reforms A populist trend that is seen everywhere including in Nepal is they point out the negative side of their opponents rather than talking about what they are going to do. “They say they are the best and the others act for foreign nations and are corrupt. They try to agitate the general public that’s it,” says Baral. This trend, according to Bidya Bhattrai, started in the Nepal parliament during the drafting of the constitution.  “Lawmakers started meeting various interest groups during that time and started bringing out issues based on their needs. Those who spoke in favour of these interest groups were made celebrities in society by these groups and this excited a lot of lawmakers,” she says. She believes and hopes that this will gradually end in the coming future but says there is need for a new political practice among Nepal parliamentarians.  “We haven’t had a proper political culture in the country but discussions have started on how politics plays a role in the formation of a society and is key to change.” She feels that lawmakers should keep in mind a few things if the country is to develop a new political culture. Nepal parliamentarians should remember the constitution before speaking along with acting keeping the law in mind and develop good practices. “These are the democratic practices that all lawmakers should follow,” she says.

Is Kul Man Ghising eyeing a parliamentary seat? Does the Maoist Centre want so?,"Kathmandu, August 31 With the CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal saying his party wants someone more popular than  Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah  to contest the parliamentary elections in Kathmandu, there are speculations that the party is approaching the  Nepal Electricity Authority  Managing Director Kul Man Ghising. Ghising, who earned  fame for ending the years-long regular power outage in Nepal  with his management skills, is reportedly loyal to the Maoist party as the Maoist leaders helped him get the top job in the authority. The party had tried to  leverage his popularity to its advantage  before the recent local elections. While Ghising has not said anything about his plan to contest the parliamentary elections, Maoist leaders say they will be more than happy if he wants to give it a try. But, the party has not officially decided anything about fielding Kul Man Ghising.  “It is not clear yet how he is thinking about the issue,” Maoist leader Himal Sharma says, “But if he is in, we are ready to give him any constituency in Kathmandu he wants.” Even if he wants to go to his birth consistency in Ramechhap, the Maoist party will leave a seat for him, according to the leaders. But, a source close to Kul Man Ghising says other political parties and independent campaigners are also encouraging the popular manager to join them.  Another leader of the Maoist party, hence, says he does not believe that Kul Man Ghising will contest the November elections.",political

Balen Shah’s bulldozing waltz: How shall it go ahead?,"When defending the rule of law, Balen Shah, the  mayor of Kathmandu  knows no limitations. His commitment to it, or should I say rigidity and formalistic adamancy, know no bounds. The poker face and the black sunglasses, which I like to think are not just there to mask his concern for the  metropolitan city , give the mayor a lot of his fierce personal flare, which nearly makes him unforgettable, and they depict a figure that is almost mythological. The work Balen Shah has been doing recently in  his bulldozing spree  may be considered unconventional, but it is democratic, and as a result, the majority of city people respect the elected messiah. But, how shall it go ahead is the question. The larger-than-life mayor The latest bulldozing spree in Kathmandu has successfully proved the fearless attitude of Balen Shah, which is something that rarely happens. Moreover, Shah on the verge of losing his cool with one of Kathmandu’s defiant landlords, he can be seen acting pretty brazenly. He maintains his position despite being impatient and angry. The act might have its fair share of narratives — a fearless Balen Shah, a heedless Balen Shah, or even a cocky Balen Shah — who with his ideas of common good dictates the fate of the city. The mayor channels utter equality in actions and is not reluctant to tie a noose whether it be on the capitalists or the courthouses. This compels me to make a comparison. On one hand, if there is an independent candidate with no allegiance to the political parties, then a larger-than-life Balen Shah is breaking the sweat for the city and his contemporaries who will take a place in history as efficient omitters of duty. Shah has been exploring the domains of power and position that his previous contemporaries failed to do. He is proof that the position of the mayor has more power than just occupying it idly. Call it whatever you want, it all contributes to his larger-than-life persona and one that succumbs to no one or nothing. However, how it will play for the city in the longer term is indeed a matter of query. A lone battle? The rogue nature of the mayor who does not shy away from stooping to public brawls for the sake of the city almost reflects a theatrical picture of the underdog mayor. One who does not believe in the etiquettes of a conventional politician nor does he entertain petty political shenanigans, his working ways induce a certain dramaturgy where a lonesome guy is adamant about changing the political system but the question is — Will Balen Shah be able to bend the system to his ways or will it be the other way around? As a resident of the city, I would definitely wish for the former, but this indeed puts his resilience at a test. It is only a matter of time before we will know if he holds his ground or the fatal flaw of politics. It is yet to see what meddles and tampers with the righteousness of the mayor saheb. Balen Shah stood as a fray of change where most people probably had their fair share of scepticism and anticipation about the new underdog. His fiercely swift actions have consolidated him as a mascot of the essential change that was expected and above all required. Quite contrary to the scepticism that the critic posed of his mayorship, Balen Shah seems to be disinterested in the sophistication of negotiation but quite believes in finally mending all the wrongs of the city. Moreover, he does it by confronting them and calling them out with his flair. An independent candidate Shah has his ideologies, his actions and his devotion all moulded into the betterment of the city.",political

Sher Bahadur Deuba hasn’t lost any election since 1990. What about this time?,"Every five years, a lot of candidates give in their names to contest the election from Dadeldhura. But, in the end, only one person wins. That person is Sher Bahadur Deuba.  A lot of them have tried since 1990, but no one has been able to ruffle Deuba’s feathers in his home district in Dadeldhura. Even when Nepali Congress suffered one of its worst defeats in the 2017 elections, Deuba won his constituency comfortably. Post-election, he was even confronted by leaders and cadres of his party who demanded his resignation, but instead, Deuba told the leaders they had no right to speak as non of them had won seats like him. “Why should I resign for your poor showing? How is it fair,” Deuba reportedly told them. And, he was right. Senior leaders like Ram Chandra Poudel, Shekhar Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, Ram Sharan Mahat and Purna Bahadur Khadka had all lost. Even ‘young leaders’ like Bishwa Prakash Sharma did not do well. Leaders like Shashanka Koirala, Gagan Thapa and Minendra Rijal did win their constituencies, but they were not powerful enough to stop Deuba as he remained the president of the party. But, what about this time? Will Sher Bahadur Deuba win the parliamentary election this time? Luck or labour? A while back, Sher Bahadur Deuba had gone to an astrologer who had told him he would become a prime minister seven times. But, even he must have doubted this when he became  Nepali Congress parliamentary party leader  after defeating Prakash Man Singh in 2018 as his party was in a clear minority. But, things changed for him in 2021 after then prime minister KP Sharma  Oli dissolved the parliament   twice . The move was called unconstitutional by members of his own party.  Following that, the erstwhile  Nepal Communist Party also got dissolved , thus opening the door for  Deuba to become prime minister  yet again. Deuba’s image at the party is not great. There are some who revere him and praise him for the work he has done for Nepali Congress. But, the other side sees things differently as they claim as Deuba has become stronger, Nepali Congress has become weaker. The general public also does not like how Sher Bahadur Deuba governs the country. Many want him to lose in the election too as he has time and again failed to live up to people’s expectations. But, that is not likely as Nepali Congress has a certain level, which will help the party and Deuba to get votes during the upcoming elections too. Many people claim that this year, Deuba will win his constituency with more votes than he has in the past. Why? It is because he is the prime minister; he has the support of the coalition; he has an increasing influence at the local level, sympathy due to old age and weak opposition. The best is yet to come As mentioned above, Sher Bahadur Deuba has not lost an election and has been a member of the parliament six times. The upcoming election will be his seventh and it is highly likely he will win again. Out of the six times, there has only been a tight race once when Khagaraj Bhatta from Maoist Centre came close but lost to Deuba by 1,368 votes in 2008. Apart from that, he has been strolling every election. This year, it is expected he will record a landslide victory as Maoist Centre, which Bhatta represents, is a part of the Nepali Congress-led coalition. Times have changed so much that Bhatta has been praising Deuba and how he has become a stalwart of the Nepali Congress, a party dominated by  the Koiralas . “People like Ganesh Man Singh left the party due to the Koiralas while a leader like Krishna Prasad Bhattarai struggled too. But, look at Sher Bahadur Deuba. He’s ended that and has led from the front,” says Bhatta. This goes to show how Bhatta is trying to help Deuba, which he believes will help him get a seat in the Provincial Assembly as he is aiming to become a chief minister of Sudurpaschim. Bhatta says if he is not given a ticket to compete for the post of chief minister, he wants to contest the federal election from either Kailali or Kanchanpur. The  UML split  is also a reason for Sher Bahadur Deuba to do well in the upcoming election. The recently formed CPN-Unified Socialist has an okay reach in Dadeldhura. But, as it is trying to join the coalition, there is likely to be no one who can compete with Deuba in his constituency. There is also a feeling that since this is most likely his last election as he is 76, he will get a lot of sympathy votes from his voters who want to see him win one last time. He has also always been open to people from his area. People close to Deuba say he has always opened his doors to the people whether he is in Baluwatar (the PM’s official residence) or in Budhanilakantha (his private residence). “He meets everyone. He helps everyone who wants help with medical and educational expenses and even finds jobs for people. This helps him during elections for sure,” says a leader close to Sher Bahadur Deuba. He is also on the top of the list of leaders who spend money to please cadres and voters alike. Even when others struggle given  how expensive elections are , Deuba never does and that helps him get additional votes. “He doesn’t think and distributes money like it’s nothing,” says a leader from Dadeldhura. Deuba is also helped by the UML’s poor planning when it comes to Dadeldhura. Since 1992, there has been no competition from the UML as it has not increased votes since then. But, UML leader Gajendra Shahi does not agree. He says that the UML is the second biggest party in the district.  “We still compete with Nepali Congress and Maoists despite their coalition. Look at the difference in votes in 1992 and now,” says Shahi. The district has added 12,000 new voters. Representing the new generation, independent  Sagar Dhakal has announced  to contest the election and go against Deuba. After visiting the district, Dhakal says he is positive. He says the locals from the area are upset with Sher Bahadur Deuba. But, many Nepali Congress leaders say Dhakal will not be able to do anything. “The most votes Sagar Dhakal will get is 150,” says Nepali Congress district president Bhim Saud. Strong local unit During the local elections, Sher Bahadur Deuba went to Dadeldhura and  spent four days there . Karna Bahadur Malla, a close Deuba aide, had protested as his people were not given a ticket to contest the elections. Malla, a member of Nepali Congress-BP, then joined hands with the UML to take on the Nepali Congress-led coalition. But, as Deuba went there, he was able to minimise Nepali Congress-BP’s reach and improve the Nepali Congress’ influence in the district. As a result, out of the seven municipalities in the district, Nepali Congress and its coalition won five of them. It was only in  Amargadhi  that Nepali Congress did not win by a landslide. Deuba’s main interest during the local elections was Amargadhi too, where the district headquarters lies. But, the UML-backed Nepali Congress-BP leader Hari Bhattarai pushed Nepali Congress to the limit as he had more influence in the area. Sher Bahadur Deuba was under a lot of pressure. But, Bhatta lost to Nepali Congress’ Dilli Raj Joshi by 193 votes. Following his loss, Bhatta accused Deuba of using state resources to defeat him. “It was like it was me against Deuba fighting for Amargadi,” says Bhatta. “He used all his power yet he nearly lost. Is he really that powerful?” But, in other areas, Nepali Congress won comfortably. If you include votes received by ward chairs, Nepali Congress received 21,735 votes followed by the Maoists who got 12,787 votes. All these votes will most likely go to Deuba during the federal elections. Will Karna Malla be able to stop Sher Bahadur Deuba? Malla had been a close aide of Sher Bahadur Deuba in the past, but recently, he has been contesting elections against him. Malla has also been improving the influence of Nepali Congress-BP in the district. But, it has not reached the level to threaten Nepali Congress’ stronghold in the area. Nepali Congress’s recent performance in the local elections is proof that it is going to be hard to beat them.  Malla and the team in the past have constantly argued that Deuba had done nothing to develop the district despite being prime minister five times. But, the locals who know Malla has been close with Deuba for 24 years did not believe in him. “What did he do when he was with Deuba? Nothing. And, then he goes telling people Deuba didn’t do anything? How will people believe him,” says a leader in the district who argues Karna Malla is making Sher Bahadur Deuba even more powerful in the district.

Jhala Nath Khanal may become the president if the Nepali Congress-led alliance wins majority,"Kathmandu, August 21 CPN-Unified Socialist’s senior leader Jhala Nath Khanal may become the president if the alliance of the current ruling parties wins the majority of House of Representatives seats. Multiple sources say Nepali Congress President and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has assured Khanal of the high office once the term of President Bidya Devi Bhandari will be over.  Elected for her second term in March 2018 , President Bhandari is set to retire in March 2023. Nepal’s constitution  envisions an electoral college consisting of members of the federal National Assembly and the House of Representatives and the provincial assemblies to elect the head of the state and his deputy. Sources say Prime Minister Deuba offered the top position to Khanal to avoid the Unified Socialist party’s dissatisfaction with the ruling alliance. Khanal, following the local elections in May, had spoken in favour of a leftist alliance with the UML, and Deuba knows the Unified Socialist leaving his side will cost him a lot. Jhala Nath Khanal readily accepted Deuba’s offer and expressed his commitment to the current alliance. After all, he wanted to become the president in 2018 also, when it could not be possible due to the insistence of KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal to repeat Bhandari.  It also means he is unlikely to contest the parliamentary elections this time as the presidential candidate does not need to be a lawmaker.",political

House endorses the citizenship bill rejecting the president’s call for reconsideration,"Kathmandu, August 18 The House of Representatives on Thursday endorsed the controversial citizenship bill, rejecting the president’s call for reconsideration.  The bill was put to vote today without changing anything, and the majority of the lawmakers approved it. There were 135 votes in the favour whereas 60 were opposing votes. Before that, the House deliberated on the bill for over seven hours, during which lawmakers of the ruling parties spoke for the bill’s endorsement and the opposition lawmakers called for reconsideration.  Now, the bill will be sent to the National Assembly, which is also likely to endorse it given the ruling side’s majority there.

How Nepal power centres are transfusing dirty politics into already problematic prison management,"On October 4, 2021, a letter arrived at Morang Prison to surprise everybody involved in prison management there. It asked the prison to transfer Navin Rai to Jhumka Prison. This was a shock to officials at the prison as they had not recommended transferring Rai anywhere.  Usually, a transfer of a prisoner is done after a recommendation from the prison and has to be signed off by the District Administration Officer. But, nothing of that sort had happened before Rai was transferred. There was a lot of confusion surrounding this but it was only a month later that things started to make sense–when Abhishek Giri was transferred to Morang Prison from Kathmandu.  Giri was sentenced to prison for kidnapping and when he was transferred to Morang, there were protests, both inside and outside the prison. His family members were protesting outside and the inmates inside. The situation was so problematic that the police had to deploy additional security forces to defuse the situation inside the prison. Following that, the  Department of Prison Management  decided to send him to Saptari Prison instead. Giri is known for being notorious. He has been at the centre of criminal activities from the prison and has even tortured inmates in the prison. After multiple complaints, he was relocated to Dillibazar Prison in Kathmandu on April 6, 2018. But, as the Nepali Congress-led coalition came into power, Giri used his influence to get him out of Dillibazar and transferred to Morang Prison. According to a source at the Department of Prison Management, Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand was at the forefront of trying to get Giri transferred to Morang. The officials at the department regularly got calls from Khand’s secretariat putting pressure on them to transfer Giri to Morang. But, officials did not budge as they knew if Giri was sent to Morang, things would get out of hand yet again as it had in the past. But, senior government officials did not listen to them. There are many others like Giri who use their influence to get their way during their stay in Nepal’s prisons. Some use their influence to get transferred to a prison of their choice while some use it to get pardoned by the president. Others, knowing that it is impossible to get out, use their power to become guards or take up other roles in the prison management and become influencers in the prison which is like a small village. Letting everything happen inside narrow walls of the prison are political power centres from local to national levels that are already notorious for self-centric immoral activities.  “We had to cave in after Khand secretariat continued calling, asking for it. Even joint-secretary Fanindra Mani Pokharel started calling and we had to send him to Morang,” says the source from the department about Giri’s transfer. “After that, all hell broke loose in Morang.” So, last year, keeping that in mind, the department sent Giri to Saptari Prison, but that decision did not hold for long as leaders from Nepali Congress intervened. Prior to Rai’s transfer, there had been two transfers in quick succession. There are sources who say Giri played a role in this too, which meant Morang Prison had space for Giri who was laying the foundation so that his transfer to Morang would go smoothly. For that, he influenced officials to transfer nine inmates who were against him to prisons elsewhere. When Giri reached Morang, he found things the way he wanted. No one spoke against him. He got the role of the guard in the prison the one that Rai had occupied. People are scared of him so much that no one will speak a word against Giri. “Who will speak against him? If we speak we will get transferred,” says an inmate. “He has a lot of influence. People don’t want to mess with him because we fear for our life.” These guards also get other facilities. They get an allowance and their jail term is also cut down. According to a jailer, if an inmate serves as a guard for one year, their jail term is cut down by two months.  But, not all are made guards. Only those inmates who have served half their sentence are eligible if they have not been booked for homicide. A prison management directive even states that the prison officials should only make people with good behaviour as a guard. But, that is not happening as those with poor behaviour and in some cases, people who have been there for a short time are being made guards thanks to their political influences. Why political influence? Because to be a guard, the inmates’ name has to be recommended by the District Administration Office and the director general of the Department of Prison Management.  There’s another example that shows how politics is controlling prisons. Parsa Prison’s jailer Krishna Gaire is under a lot of stress. Why? Because the prison that he looks at is being subject to a lot of politics as prison guards are changing regularly and he feels helpless.  According to the department, Dinesh Yadav was made the guard of the inmates around the second week of June. But soon, a powerplay started to remove him and get someone else in. The people who were instigating this were government officials from the prime minister’s office in Baluwatar.  The department officials say that they are being pressurised to transfer Chotelal Sah, who is currently in Kathmandu’s Central Jail, and make him the guard. This would mean transferring Yadav away. “The pressure is coming from Balwatar,” says a department official. The official says that Sah, who is close to provincial lawmaker Ram Krishna Yadav, has used the minister’s reach and asked for a transfer. “If we keep changing guards like this. There will soon be chaos in the jail and the administration cannot control it,” says the official. But, why are there so many prison transfers and why are politicians involved? Well, the most obvious answer many people feel is money. Officials at the Department of Prison Management believe that an inmate spends up to Rs 2 million to become a guard. Why? Because the inmate can earn a lot during their time served as a guard. There is an estimation that a prison guard in a major prison can earn up to Rs 500,000 a month in the name of establishing a library, an infirmary and shops. Using power and influence, some inmates become VIPs in the prison. One of them is Ram Chandra Pyasi Kushwaha, a former CPN-UML lawmaker. Kusawaha has been  sent to prison for being involved in the murder  of his own party leader Mohammad Alam. Kusawaha uses his influence to jump from one prison to another. He was first taken to Dillbazar Prison then shifted to the Central Jail and is now in Birgunj Prison but has also spent time in Nakhu Prison and Sindhulu Prison. “He is a handful,” says a department official. The  Prisons Act, 1963 , the law to govern prison management in Nepal, has a provision to allow inmates to set up shops in the prison. The management of these shops is given to the guard. “They make a lot of money even if they sell things at the price things are sold for in shops outside the prison. Some earn Rs 5,000 a day just by selling tea,” says a jailer.  On top of that, these guards are also allowed to sell other items like junk food, meat and other groceries. These guards are also allowed to get out of the prison to buy these things.  “A guard is like a government official. They have so many rights and privileges that they don’t run away from prison even if they can. They love the power and want to be in power inside the prison,” says a jailer. The jailer says prison is like a village. It has a guard and the guard has his helpers who act as leaders. These people run a different political game within the prison where they are the rulers and other inmates are their subjects. It is they who solve the spats and fights that happen in the prison. The guards even get to select people who look after the kitchen, telephone and other services, so this is a very attractive post, inform prison management officials. There are 74 prisons in 72 districts in Nepal. Kathmandu and Dang have two each. Out of all the prisons, the ones of Nakhhu in Lalitpur, Central Jail and Dillibazar Prison in Kathmandu, Jhumka Prison, Morang Prison, Parsa Prison and Banke Prison are ones where there is a lot of politics and power play. “A lot of politics takes place to get to these prisons. I know it might sound weird to people who are hearing this for the first time, but things are like that there,” says an official from the department. Buy why is it so? The answer lies in the lack of facilities inside the prison in other places. Taking advantage of that, some power centres are using the lack of facilities to their advantage.  Former attorney general Yubaraj Sangraula went to Bhimphedi to monitor the prison in 2012. There, he saw 137 prisoners living in 15 rooms. The situation was dire. “There was no place to sleep, no place to cook food and no open space for them to breathe fresh air,” recalls Sangraula.  Looking at the dire state of inmates, he told officials to shift some of them elsewhere. “I told the home secretary that I would file a case against him if he didn’t transfer the inmates within two days,” he says. Bhimphedi now has a new prison. But, even the new prison is overcrowded. The Department of Prison Management says the total capacity of the prison is 335. But, there are 944 inmates in the prison. Kathmandu’s Dillibazar Prison is believed to be one of the best in the country. But, in reality, it is just as bad as anywhere else as inmates set up mattresses under someone’s bed to sleep. Those who have good relations with the guards and their aides get better facilities, but the ones who do not, live a horrible life in prison. According to a report prepared by the Department of Prison Management, almost all prisons have double the amount they can cope with.  Some have almost three times more. Former member of the Human Right Commission Mohna Ansari says Nepal’s jails are like hell. “The government gets foreign aid too, still prison management is below par. The investment done on these jails are so much that it’s shocking to see the state of them,” she says.  The role to make them better is up to the Department of Prison Management, but the officials in the department say that bettering prison management has never been a priority of the government. Sangraula says the government sends staff that it thinks are useless to the department and that is a major reason why there has not been much development. “They send people who are either under scrutiny for doing something wrong or those who are going to retire. There are even times they send people just so they can get some budget that has been set aside for groceries. It’s shocking to see that the leaders who were once in jail never did much to make it better,” says Sangraula. The state of prison management in Nepal is so bad that the director general can’t even meet the home minister when he needs to. “When I was made the DG, the home minister told me I was his first priority. But, I tried so much to meet him but was never able to,” says former director general of the department, Janak Raj Dahal, adding he then realised how unimportant prison management was for the state. An official at the department says that the director general cannot even meet the finance secretary when he wants to. In the past four months, the department has had four director generals, which shows how unstable it is.  “This shows how much the home ministry cares about prison management. A prison is a sensitive place but all that happens there is politics and that is sickening,” says Sangraula. Prison management started around the early 1900s in Nepal. The current central jail in Jagannath Dewal is believed to have been the first prison in Nepal. After 1951, the management of prisons came under the Home Ministry. To improve the prisons, the then government set up a commission under Subarna Shumsher Rana. The commission had recommended that the first thing the government needed to do was provide better living conditions, food, and clothes to the inmates. After democracy was established in 1990, another committee was formed. Since then, multiple committees have prepared multiple reports on improving prison management. “Almost all of them said the same thing. Until the government’s perception changes, nothing is going to change,” says Dahal, who believes a lot needs to be done to turn prisons into rehabilitation centres. Dahal believes that it was time the government utilised the 25,000 plus inmates that are in prison and use it as a force and use them in development activities. “Over 60 per cent of inmates are skilled. We can use it to our advantage. This would help change their mental well-being and maybe we could turn a prison into a rehab,” says Dahal. But, Sangaraula believes neither the government nor society wants better prison management. “We feel that a prisoner is not human. This is a major reason why we haven’t been able to improve our prisons.”  This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

The leader of the  eight-month-old Janata Pragatishil Party  (People’s Progressive Party) met UML chairman KP Sharma Oli on Monday and discussed the alliance. Tripathi had left his old Rastriya Janata Party Nepal  just before the 2017 parliamentary elections and had contested and won the election as a CPN-UML candidate. Although Tripathi claimed he was a member of an independent political group during and after the election, legally, he has been a UML lawmaker. “There has been an alliance of the ruling parties. Hence, we discussed if we can go together,” Tripathi says after the meeting. It is not known what Oli replied to him.",political
Samikchya Baskota appointed Bibeksheel Sajha Party chairperson,"Kathmandu, August 15 Bibeksheel Sajha Party has appointed Samikchya Baskota as the new chairperson of the party. Baskota succeeds Rabindra Mishra, who  resigned after the party’s poor performance  in the local elections in May, as the leader of a  failing alternative force . With  Mishra outspokenly advocating for the reinstatement of monarchy  in Nepal these days, it is not certain if he will remain committed to the party that has remained a house divided over crucial issues such as republicanism, federalism and secularism. A  statement issued by the party  on Sunday says the party’s central committee meeting yesterday picked Baskota as the chairperson. She was the party’s contestant for the mayor of the Kathmandu metropolitan city in the last elections.  Meanwhile, the party also appointed Sanjeev Ballav Bhattarai as the coordinator of the party. The party also decided to register itself with the Election Commission for the November elections and begin preparations for the vote.",political
"President suggests revision to citizenship bill, sends back to parliament","Kathmandu, August 14 In what seems a conflict with the government, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has returned the citizenship bill endorsed by  both houses of the parliament , calling the legislative for a revision. Whereas the constitution requires the head of the state to either endorse or send back any bill in 15 days, President Bhandari made the negative move on the 14th day of receiving the draft law of the citizenship bill. The second amendment to the Citizenship Act was aimed at addressing concerns of the Madhesh-centric parties and the Non-resident Nepali Association. However, it was drawn into controversy citing the citizenship bill did not bar foreign women marrying Nepali men from getting citizenship easily. Self-claimed nationalist activists had expressed concerns that loose citizenship provisions in Nepal could give the dominating India to gradually push its citizens to Nepal and perpetuate its control over the small county. The main opposition, CPN-UML, despite not officially making strong protests in parliament, had unofficially called the president to not endorse the bill. President Bhandari was a member of the party before her election to the top office in 2015. This perhaps is the second biggest conflict between the executive government and the ceremonial head of the state in the republic of Nepal since 2008. In 2009, President Ram Baran Yadav revoked the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government’s decision to sack Nepal Army Chief Rookmamgad Katwal. The move had led to the  end of Dahal’s premiership . As in the 2009 case, the recent move is also certain to divide the nation between for and against the president and the government.",political

Baburam Bhattarai’s party borrowing Maoist Centre’s symbol to contest the November elections,"Kathmandu, August 14 The Baburam Bhattarai-led Nepal Samajbadi Party is borrowing the Maoist Centre’s election symbol (hammer and sickle inside a circle) for the  upcoming November elections . Bhattarai met Maoist Centre chairman and his former commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal several times over the past week and made an agreement to contest the elections in the same symbol, according to Mahindra Raya Yadav, another chairman of Bhattarai’s party. A formal decision, however, is yet to be made and the two leaders will sign a deal after internal discussions in their respective parties, Yadav says.  Further, they have not decided on the number of constituencies the NSP will contest with the Maoist Centre’s election symbol.

Khadka is on a  three-day visit to China. On the occasion, Minister Khadka reiterated Nepal’s unswerving stance on the one-China policy, noting Nepal would not allow the use of its territory for any activity against China. Foreign Minister Yang also talked about China’s continued and unconditional support and solidarity for Nepal’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and assured to provide assistance in Nepal’s development efforts as per the Nepal government priorities.

How Nepal’s first lady is becoming the country’s de facto ruler,"Of late, lineage is no more advantage in Nepal’s grand old Nepali Congress party. Apparently, the political life of people like Shashanka Koirala, Sujata Koirala, Prakash Man Singh and Sirjana Shrestha Singh is approaching the denouement.  Arzu Rana Deuba , the “scholarly” wife of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, however, is trying to be an exception. If you look at her recent actions, it is evident that she is trying her best to make the most of her husband’s positions to make a statement in Nepali politics. If you look at it from a political standpoint, she is the country’s first lady. So her active role in politics is not unnatural as she has even been a Constituent Assembly member in the past.  But, what is strange is her active role in party politics and state affairs as if Arzu Rana Deuba is the de facto ruler of the country.  “It’s impossible to object or speak against Arzu madam,” says a Nepali Congress leader. “It feels like we’ve gone back in time. People would be petrified to say anything against Queen Ashwariya Shah (King Birendra’s wife) during the monarchy. Arzu has a similar effect.” The NC leader says Arzu Rana Deuba’s network in the government and the party has grown stronger and stronger in recent times. Helping her become influential are industrialists, contractors and businesspersons, says the leader. “Her concerns are mostly about financial affairs,” he says. The NC leader says businesspersons and NC members like Binod Chaudhary, Anil Rungta,  Umesh Shrestha , Indra Baniya and Deepak Khadka are her main motivators. Another Nepali Congress leader accuses Arzu of controlling the country’s administrative mechanism after her husband became the prime minister. “She showed that she was the one controlling bureaucracy. It all started with the Planning Commission,” says the NC leader. PM Deuba had reportedly called economist Shakar Sharma from the US to make him the vice-chair of the  National Planning Commission . But, after Arzu Rana Deuba intervened, the prime minister reluctantly made  Biswo Nath Poudel the vice-chair of the commission . It is not that Poudel was not eligible; he is more than capable of leading the commission. It just left a bad taste as he entered the commission through the backdoor.  Arzu Rana Deuba is the chair of Ullens School while Poudel was its board member.  But, people close to Poudel say he was Deuba’s choice too. A source close to Poudel tells Onlinekhabar that Deuba had called Poudel two days after being the prime minister telling him he would be the new vice-chair of the planning body. “Prime Minister does listen to others, but he does what he wants. I don’t think Biswo Poudel got the position due to Arzu madam,” he says. After being unable to make Sharma the vice-chair of the commission, Deuba appointed him  Nepal’s ambassador to India .  Arzu Rana Deuba played a major role in appointing ambassadors too. Sources say it was her who recommended the names of Shreedhar Khatri and Durga Bahadur Subedi to become ambassadors to the US and Japan respectively. “We’re not questioning their ability, but the manner in which they have been appointed is questionable,” says an NC leader. Umesh Shreshta, who was appointed the state health minister on July 25, 2021, is someone who is close to Arzu Rana Deuba. Sources say Arzu played a major role in the promotion and transfer of people within the ministry during his tenure. After the Health Ministry was given to the CPN-Unified Socialist, PM Deuba gave Shrestha the role of looking after the Prime Minister’s Office. Following that, Arzu then started to keep a keen interest in the promotion and transfer of officials in ministries that were being led by the Nepali Congress leaders. Examples of this are the appointment of  Umesh Prasad Thani as the executive director  of Nepal Oil Corporation, Bikal Poudel as the executive director of Security Printing Centre, Sunil Poudel as the managing director of Nepal Telecom and Pradeep Adhikari as the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. She has also started to show a keen interest in the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering Investigation. The director-general of the Department of Revenue Investigation usually reports to the chief secretary of the government. But recently, the official has been constantly meeting Arzu Rana Deuba to brief her. A source says Arzu’s brother, Bhusan Rana, also has a keen insertest in cases related to revenues. Hence, a source even says Arzu even tried her best to interfere in a case against a multinational company. But, officials from the Department of Revenue Investigation did not allow her to do so. Sources also say that cases in the Department of Money Laundering Investigation have not gone ahead due to interference from Arzu Rana Deuba. “ Prithvi Bahadur Shah’s case  is one of them,” says a source. Kuldev Thapa, who was on the verge of retiring from the National Investigation Department, got promoted as the additional chief investigation officer thanks to the first lady’s favour.  Narayan Khadka is the Minister for Foreign Affairs. But, when it comes to relations with India and the United States, Arzu Rana Deuba looks more active than him. She has personally tried to mend relations with India’s Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP), which was angry with Nepal over the new map. Last year, she even met BJP’s foreign affairs department chief Vijay Chauthaiwale and tied a rakhi. Since then, she has been  regularly visiting him in New Delhi . Her actions have created frictions within the party as people have accused her of bypassing the official channels and not adhering to protocols. “She’s not the prime minister. Neither is she a minister. She cannot be going around, doing what she pleases,” said a Nepali Congress leader. Arzu Rana Deuba became a central member of the Nepali Congress during the party’s 14th general convention in December 2021. If you look at it, she was very new to party politics. But, she was actively involved in picking people during the general convention. “She called people and asked them to be ready to contest the party election from the Deuba panel. Many people won thanks to her,” says a source from Nepali Congress. Out of the 148 central committee members of the prime minister’s party, 82 per cent are from Deuba’s panel. As the number of central members increased, many new people got the chance to be central committee members. But, most of the new members from Deuba’s panel are close to Arzu. “These new people dance to Arzu madam’s beat,” says a source. “If there is a vote within the party, I think Arzu will win to be the most popular leader.” But, central member Rajeev Dhungana feels people are spreading unnecessary gossip about Arzu Rana Deuba. “People protest for the sake of protesting because her meeting anyone is being subject to criticism,” says Dhungana. Another central committee member Ram Hari Khatiwada says it was stupid to think PM Deuba did everything his wife told him to do. A lot of members of the Nepali Congress have been calling Arzu Rana Deuba the future prime minister. According to them, there is talk of Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre sharing the government leadership in turn. If that happens, according to them, it is highly likely that Arzu will be prime minister at least once. But, to be prime minister, one has to be a member of the House of Representatives. However, Arzu, during the 2017 elections lost to Narad Muni Rana when she contested the elections from Kailali-5.  Whether she will contest the elections from the same place or choose another one remains to be seen. But, sources claim her contesting the elections from Kailali is the safest option. Nonetheless, things are not going to be straight forwards as independent candidate  Gopal Hamal won  over Arzu Rana Deuba’s pick in the recent mayoral election in Dhangadhi, a major chunk of her constituency.  “Unless she can find a way to get Hamal on her side, it is not going to be straightforward for her,” says a leader from Kailali. To gain popularity among the locals, Arzu Rana Deuba has made Jeevan Rana, a local Tharu leader, a central committee member of the party. But, how much that helps her remains to be seen as Prakash Bam from the Deuba panel will pose another threat to her. “It won’t be a surprise if she doesn’t contest the elections directly,” say NC leaders.

"Kalapani dispute: Past, present and future of the Nepal-India row explained","Nepal has held pride in its historical battles and the bravado of the forefathers who fought gallantly against any foreign invasion. In history, one of the most debated and remembered fights is in Kalapani. Nepal won the fight back then, but in the recent decade, the Kalapani dispute has resurfaced.  Nepal’s Kalapani dispute with India is one of the sore spots for any Nepali citizen as it is yet to be in the clear. People time and again are seen pouring even their extreme forms of expressions against the other country. Without the plurality of the content that might inundate you at the peak of the dispute, here is a summary of what the Kalapani dispute is all about. Before we get into the details, first let us know the details of the area of the Kalapani dispute.  Kalapani is the area in the Darchula district of the Sudurpaschim province of Nepal that borders the eastern front of Uttarakhand in India. The area lies in the southern half of the Kalapani river basin or on the banks of the Mahakali river. It is situated at 3,650 m to 6,180 m above sea level and has an area of 35 square km. It only has some 100 people living in the area. Kalapani is a  tri-junction  point between India, Nepal and China. It is important to Nepal and India regarding the border dispute. But, not just that, India and China also find the area important as the pass to build a road connecting Indian pilgrims to Kailash Mansarover in Tibet. It is also a place of strategic importance for India and China to logistically build up military troops on the border. In the early 19th century, the East India Company (EIC) that was ruling India began expanding its territories and reached northwards near Nepal. Soon after, on November 1, 1814, a war broke out with the Nepali side.  In 1815, the British general Sir David Ochterlony managed to evict the Nepali soldiers from Garhwal and Kumaon. A year later, the war came to an end with  the Sugauli Treaty .  In October–November 1962, the Sino-Indian war broke out. The same year, then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a personal letter to the then Nepali King Mahendra requesting the latter to let the retreating India Army stay temporarily in an open area in Kalapani. India’s encroachment on Lipulekh, another area in the region, first came to light during the Panchayat period, but no effort was made for negotiations. There are no records in Nepal to suggest that these demarcations were done jointly between the British East India Company and Nepal.  King Mahendra is blamed for allowing Indian troops into Kalapani after the 1962 India-China war, at India’s request, even though there are no official records or statements substantiating the blame. According to foreign affairs expert Bhek Bahadur Thapa, King Mahendra never gave written permission but had planned to take up this issue with India when the war ended, but he never came to it. India and China agreed even as far back as 1954 to allow Indian pilgrims to  Kailash Mansarovar  to use the Lipulekh pass. The shifting of the international boundary based on changes in the course of a mountain river does not hold water, literally. Even if these changes in the course of the river were depicted in the maps published by the Survey of India during British rule, they cannot be used as a reference in deciding the international border. But, in November 2019,  India included the disputed area in its official map , the region east of Lipu Khola as a part of its territory. Later, Indian Defence Minister  Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Indian road via the disputed tri-junction  of Nepal, India and China. These events brought the Kalapani dispute to a new height, and Nepal also retaliated by  amending its constitution  to include  the disputed region on its map also . The Kalapani dispute is all about whether the Kalapani-Limpiadhura-Lipulekh land is a part of present-day India or Nepal. There have been several attempts to resolve this dispute. There was no substantial progress in solving the Kalapani dispute till 1990. After Nepal got democracy, the dispute gained traction again. Mahakali Treaty Kalapani in Nepal’s national map Nepal’s national charter was amended Thus began the downpour of official statements from the government of Nepal and India. Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said India’s move was a ‘unilateral act’ and urged India to stop all the activities as it was against the bilateral understanding.   India replied claiming the disputed Kalapani area was its area and was a part of its plan for the 70km-road to travel to Lake Mansarovar in Tibet. Nepal has been suggested to appeal to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with the right documents and maps related to its demarcation after the Sugauli Treaty. Yet, the Kalapani dispute is not solved yet with both sides making contrasting claims further. India says it is ready to give up the disputed land if Nepal gives enough solid evidence. In May 2020,  Indian Army Chief Gen MM Naravane gave a statement saying that Nepal’s move to publish a new map and raise the Kalapani dispute was influenced by a third party, to which  Nepal Army had also reacted . India included the disputed area in its official map Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Indian road via the disputed tri-junction amending its constitution the disputed region on its map also",political

Lalitpur District Court’s arrest warrant against Biplav and other leaders of his party,"Kathmandu, August 1 The Lalitpur District Court has issued an arrest warrant in the name of Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’, the chief of a small communist party.

The law enforcers have been told to arrest them and present them before the court in the next 35 days.  The court says it is hearing arms and ammunition, murder and crimes against the state involving them.  Biplav had formed a party after breaking ties with Mohan Baidya, a veteran Maoist leader, in November 2014.

Why could Janardan Sharma’s comeback boomerang on Sher Bahadur Deuba and his coalition?,"Janardan Sharma once again assumed office  as the country’s finance minister  on Sunday. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, after the  parliamentary committee  stated it  did not find any evidence  to prove Sharma was guilty, reappointed him to the position that  Sharma had left  after a serious controversy around a month ago. Everyone knows Sharma was under fire after  Annapurna Post reported that  he changed tax rates in the  budget plan  for the new fiscal year that would begin in mid-July 2022 under some industrialists’ pressure. Although the House committee could not find any evidence of the illegal interference, thus absolving Sharma, many believe the panel, in fact,  did not make serious efforts  to complete its assignment. This reappointment, hence, has set a bad precedence. Yes, the committee might not have found proof of Sharma’s wrongdoing. But, PM Sher Bahadur Deuba and his coalition partner, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, recommending Janardan Sharma for the position of finance minister despite there being a very good case against him not being innocent makes a mockery of good governance and accountability.  Janardan Sharma’s reappointment particularly sets bad precedence as it takes place on the eve of the announcement of federal and provincial elections and might be risky for both Deuba and Dahal in the long run. The parliamentary committee prepared its report with limited resources. The report clearly has more questions than answers as the committee has only said that it could not determine if he was innocent or guilty. It also found no proof that the allegations against Sharma were baseless. But, appointing Sharma when there are a lot of legal and administrative questions to answer is a mindboggling decision. The main opposition, the CPN-UML, being coy about this makes things even more problematic. There are accusations that the party does not want to raise this issue as it believes the ruling coalition will not bring up  the M Adhikari case  it is caught itself under in recent times. For whatever reasons, it seems the main opposition party does not want any confrontation with the ruling coalition before the elections.  Janardan Sharma, even before this, faced a lot of criticism. He was accused of not being literate about the general principles of the macroeconomic system including the economic and financial policies of the country. Many of his decisions about insurance and troubled industrial enterprises had triggered controversies from time to time.   The finance minister plays an important role in deciding where the country’s economy is heading. For that, the minister has to show strong leadership and should be confident that he can lead the country to economic growth. But listening to Sharma, during his time as finance minister, there is enough evidence that he has not been able to do so. He has been at odds with the Nepal Rastra Bank for a while as he  tried to oust NRB Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari . He had gone out of line to intervene in the functioning of the autonomous body. Minister Sharma has been accused of  backing Prithvi Bahadur Shah , a resident of Achham, who is under the scrutiny of the central bank and the Department of Money Laundering Investigation for bringing millions of US dollars into the bank account in a suspicious manner. The Supreme Court had even told Sharma what he could do and not do as the finance minister of the country. Disregarding all these, Deuba and Dahal have reinstated Janardan Sharma as the finance minister. Universally, it is believed that democratic governments listen to people’s wishes and expectations and make efforts to address them. But, the coalition government just walked the opposite path. This is not all. The ruling parties had a chance to appoint someone qualified for the post. Someone who knew the ins and outs of economics… Someone who the public would trust… Someone who could take on internal and external challenges and take the country to the next level. This was a chance to show the public that the government cared about the economy and did something to make sure that the economy, which is already fragile, would not get worse.  But, with the appointment of Janardan Sharma, they have ruined all of this as it did what it felt was right, not what was right for the country.

Janardan Sharma is back as the finance minister (Updated),"Kathmandu, July 31 CPN-Maoist Centre leader Janardan Sharma has been appointed the finance minister.

Dahal’s secretary Ramesh Malla says Sharma will be sworn in as the minister this evening.  Sharma  resigned from the same position  on July 6 after the House of Representatives  formed a special committee  to look into the charges that he let unauthorised persons enter the meeting to finalise the annual budget plan and tweak some tax charges.  Janardan Sharma was under fire after  Annapurna Post reported that  he changed tax rates in the  budget plan  for the new fiscal year that would begin in mid-July 2022 under some industrialists’ pressure. As the news reported that the industrialists’ representatives entered the ministry office on the eve of the budget announcement to tamper with the document, there was a call to investigate the CCTV footage. But, the ministry had said the footage was automatically deleted. Upon the House committee’s request, Nepal Police  recovered some clips , but the committee has concluded they were so unclear that it could not generate any evidence. The committee had quizzed Janardan Sharma over the charges, but  he pleaded innocent . Following that, the committee submitted its report saying it  could not find any evidence of irregularities , thereby giving a clean chit to him. However, there are calls for not appointing him as the minister again as people believe the  investigation was not serious as it was meant to absolve him .",political

Province 1 unlikely to get its name before the next Provincial Assembly elections,"Biratnagar, July 24 Province 1, the only province yet to be named, is unlikely to get its name before the next Provincial Assembly elections. The  2015 constitution , introducing federalism, divided the country into seven provinces without naming them. Provincial legislative units formed after the first provincial assembly elections, conducted in 2017, were assigned to name the provinces. Accordingly, all six provinces have already been named, but Province 1 has failed.  It is unlikely that the province will be named in the term of the current provincial assembly as the  elections are just a few months away  and the parties are still divided. Chief Minister Rajendra Kumar Rai has already said the assembly should now hand over the responsibility to the newly elected officials as they fail to find consent. In particular, the CPN-UML has been insisting that the province be named Koshi whereas other parties are for other names that reflect the ethnic identities of the people there.

House passes amendment to Nepal’s citizenship law. Here are 3 major changes the bill will make,"The House of Representatives on Friday endorsed an amendment to Nepal’s citizenship law by majority votes. The bill will now move to the National Assembly before the president enacts this to become a part of the citizenship law.  Over recent years, Nepal’s parliament and other stakeholders have talked a lot about the country’s citizenship law. The bill to amend the  Nepal Citizenship Act, 2006 , had been pending in parliament since August 2018.  The bill was discussed time and again, yet the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House of Representatives was not able to build a consensus on the bill. Despite the discussions, even major political parties have been at odds over the provision to grant citizenship to foreign women married to Nepali men. Citing this, the government, as recently as July 5,  withdrew the bill  to amend the citizenship law. This brought a lot of criticism, but the government was so determined that it made the House pass the bill through a fast track method at the House of Representatives.  In doing so, it has addressed three major issues concerning the citizenship law. They are explained here.  Before the constitution was drafted in 2015, the government would also issue citizenship by birth along with citizenship by descent and naturalised citizenship. This meant any child born within a country’s borders or territory was automatically granted citizenship in the country if the person did not have other citizenship. But, the government did not include that provision in the  constitution,  which means the children of those who got their citizenship by birth have not been able to get their citizenship. Addressing this, the proposed amendment to the citizenship law aims to give citizenship by descent to those born to parents with citizenship born to citizens by birth. This proposal seems to have been accepted by all major political parties. The constitution states that the government can hand out citizenship to anyone with their mother’s name. But, since the government has not made corresponding changes to the citizenship law, this constitutional provision  has not been implemented yet . The proposed amended has addressed this too. Once the law is in effect, those who have not been able to get their citizenship through their mother will also be given citizenship by descent if he/she is living in Nepal. This even goes for people who do not know who their fathers are. For this, the mother has to self-declare that the father does not exist. But, if the declaration is false, the government will take action against as per law. Non-resident Nepalis around the world had been repeatedly telling the government that they believe in the ‘once a Nepali, always a Nepali’ slogan. Listening to them, the government has tried to address this in the amendment. Accordingly, a different type of citizenship would be given to them. The citizenship will give them economic, social and cultural rights. But, these people would not have any political rights, meaning these people cannot vote, contest an election and get appointed in public posts.",political

What message did Liu Jianchao bring to Kathmandu on Nepal-China relations?,"It was only in 2003 that the Chinese government gave its first official view on the  armed conflict  that started in Nepal in 1996. “A group in Nepal are defaming our respected leader  Mao Zedong ,” their statement read. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, taking in Mao Zedong’s ideology, formed the Maoist party and declared war against the state. As the war affected a lot of people in Nepal, it was talked about everywhere in the world.  Even though China condemned the Maoist party, Dahal was merely following what Mao did in China in the early 1900s – using the people of the country to start a revolution. As this was happening, many forces around the world were even speculating if Dahal was being deployed by China to take a stand against the US and India. But, China said it had nothing to do with this.  The person who wrote the statement was Liu Jianchao, a Chinese politician known for silent diplomacy.  Liu Jianchao is now the  head of the International Liaison Department  of the  Chinese Communist Party . Earlier this week, he  was in Nepal  on a four-day visit.  His visit comes at an interesting time. Nepal is now preparing for the provincial and federal elections. It is likely that the Maoist Centre will continue its coalition with the Nepali Congress for  the elections . But, many are suspecting that the Chinese politician was here to try and convince the communist parties to merge again and contest the elections as they did during the 2017 elections. Even though the Nepal Communist Party did not last for long, China did its very best to make sure Nepal’s two major communist parties, the CPN-UML and Maoist Centre, did not split. But, it was not successful. So, what was the message that Liu Jianchao brought to Nepal? Nepal has been at a crossroads between China and the United States. After a lot of controversy, Nepal’s  parliament ratified the US-led Millenium Challenge Corporation  (MCC). But, after much criticism, Nepal decided  not to take part in the State Partnership Program  (SPP). Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has also been accused of trying to be distant from China. This is why everyone was looking at how the government would take the visit of a Chinese official coming to Nepal.  Liu Jianchao met almost all the prominent leaders in Nepal. He met Prime Minister Deuba, President Bidya Devi Bhandari, opposition leader KP Sharma Oli, and ruling coalition partners Madhav Nepal and Pushpa Kamal Dahal among others. In these meetings, he is believed to have told Nepali leaders that China will not interfere in Nepali politics and will accept what Nepali leaders choose. Sources said that Liu was the freest when he was speaking to President Bhandari. He spent nearly an hour with Bhandari telling her his intentions to visit Nepal. “China wants to have good relations with all countries. We want to be good neighbours and help Nepal in development works,” Liu told Bhandari according to a source at the President’s Office. Liu Jianchao also told her he came to Nepal to understand what the leaders wanted for the country and told Bhandari he found Nepali leaders were positive towards Nepal. In reply, Bhandari thanked China for the help it provided to Nepal in recent years, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. There is a feeling among people that China also wants to improve its relationships with the Nepali Congress. Late NC leader BP Koirala had some good ties with China. He played an integral role in admitting China into the United Nations.  Liu Jianchao has used Koirala’s name to get close to Congress leaders, sources say. He first met leaders of the party and kept on bringing up BP Koirala’s name during the discussion and stated how China and Nepali Congress have had a good relationship in the past. He even mentioned how Koirala’s surname was famous in China. He even went to the BP Koirala Museum in Sundarijal where he showed a lot of interest in learning about the late leader. Liu repeatedly told the leaders how BP Koirala stood up to the world when China was excluded from the United Nations.  “It looks like China wants to improve its relationship with Congress because I think China finally feels Nepali Congress is an important party here,” says a source who attended the meeting.  Around 2018, China’s relations with Nepali Congress had been limited to mere formality as its main focus was to strengthen the erstwhile Nepal Communist Party. When Congress lawmaker Jeevan Bahadur  Shahi talked about how China was encroaching Nepali land  in the north, China was not pleased. When Chinese President  Xi Jinping visited Nepal , there was doubt if he would meet Congress President Deuba. Xi did meet Deuba, but it was a mere formality. After Xi’s visit, one Chinese media even dubbed Nepali Congress a pro-India party while the Chinese  Embassy in Kathmandu wrote to Nepali Congress  asking it to control its members from giving out irresponsible opinions. Nepali Congress then dubbed the embassy’s letter baseless stating its members had done nothing wrong. But, things are different now. The NCP does not exist and the Nepali Congress has partnered with two communist parties to form the government. And, since this coalition looks likely to stay put for a while, China has seen the need to convince Nepali Congress that it is its friend. “Visits like Liu Jianchao’s have meaning especially if it comes before an election. Seems like China is doing its best to send a message to Nepal that it is with the country no matter who is in power,” says a CPN-UML leader. Nepali Congress leaders also feel the same. They understand how important China is.  But, China still wants the communist coalition. During this visit, Liu Jianchao could not hide it as he tried to see if there was a future possibility that the communist parties would come together.

Nepal’s stateless people: This is how the withdrawal of the citizenship amendment bill was undesirable,"Raju Prajapati, 21, a permanent resident of Birgunj, expresses his disappointment over the government’s decision to withdraw Nepal Citizenship Act Amendment Bill. He is eligible to get citizenship as his father is a Nepali citizen by birth and his mother is a citizen of descent. Both of his grandparents are also citizenship holders.  “But, we cannot provide your citizenship by your mother’s identity unless the government passes the Citizenship Amendment Bill”, this is what he often gets to hear from government officials whenever he visits the government office for his citizenship. On July 8, Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand submitted a proposal of withdrawal for the pending citizenship amendment Bill, which was tabled on August 7, 2018, by the then CPN-UML government. The proposal was passed by the majority in the lower house. The proposal was submitted as per the cabinet decision.  Now, these citizenship seekers have a long struggle to go through as the withdrawal was apparently undesirable. The withdrawal of the bill has converted almost four years of economic and human resources into waste. The State Affairs Committee held 34 meetings whereas its subcommittee held nine meetings, which cost more than Rs 1.3 million.  But, a significant number of media just limited themselves to disseminating the information, quietly observing the injustices. The ethnocentric garrulous civil society and their human rights defenders prevented themselves from speaking up when their interest is not directly involved. Had it been concerned with the lives of high-caste Hindu elites from the hills, the whole media, civil societies, human rights defenders, political party youth organisations and lawmakers themselves would have made it a headline of the day. But, thanks to their apathy, everything has gone to waste. Now, the government is planning to bring another similar bill and pass it before the tenure of the House of Representatives ends before November. But, people doubt their intention. How could a bill, which had not been passed for more than three years, will be passed within three months?  This sounds beyond our lawmakers’ capacity. “Citizenship is man’s basic right for it is nothing less than the right to have rights,” a former chief justice of the US, Earl Warren, has rightly commented. One cannot even imagine exercising dozens of fundamental rights without it.  Otherwise, the government can simply avoid fulfilling its duties towards them if they are not citizens. These stateless people cannot register birth, buy or sell land, compete for higher-level examinations for positions in government offices, file for a change of address, acquire a passport, open bank accounts, register for voting and cannot even get a sim card.  Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ), 1948, mentions each individual has an undeniable and indivisible right to nationality, which builds a sense of identity for him/her. Nepal is a signatory state to UDHR. Hence, the  Constitution of Nepal  in its article 10 states that no citizen of Nepal shall be deprived of the right to obtain citizenship.  Article 11 has provisioned  certain conditions to be citizens of Nepal . A person whose father or mother was a citizen of Nepal at the time of his or her birth can attain citizenship by descent, as article 11(2) has provisioned. Similarly, as per article 11(3), a child of citizens who obtained citizenship by birth can acquire the citizenship of Nepal by descent in the case of the child’s father and mother both are citizens of Nepal.  But, millions of Nepali citizens–including the children of citizens who acquired citizenship by birth, and children whose mother acquired citizenship by descent but the father is either unknown or is a foreign national–are  deprived of the fundamental right  due to a lack of appropriate federal law.  Moreover, Nepal has ratified International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ), 1976. How can an individual enjoy their civil and political freedoms when they are not recognised as citizens by their own state? The country’s laws and involvement in international treaties and conventions merely remain as a collection of words for those who are stateless and whose life is full of uncertainties. The state’s ethnocentric approach and patriarchy are the major reasons why it is still what it is. They are explained below: In Nepal, historically, high-caste Hindu elites have dominated in all spectrums of social life. Dr Hari Bans Jha writes, “Till the 1950s, Madheshi people were treated as aliens in their own land. Until 1958, the black Madheshi required a passport-like document before entering Kathmandu.” The constitution in 1962 made ‘Nepali origin’ and ‘ability to speak and write in Nepali’ mandatory to obtain Nepali citizenship on basis of naturalisation. Government officials interpreted ‘Nepali origin’ as the pahadi (hill) origin. Most Madheshis did not speak or write the Nepali language, so they were deprived of citizenship. The 1990 constitution not only repealed the provision of citizenship by birth but also made it mandatory for non-citizenship holders to stay for 15 years to qualify for citizenship. The Centre for Economic and Technical Studies in the early 1990s conducted a survey, which showed around 16 per cent of sample households of Madheshi were not recognised as citizens. After the 2006 democratic movement, the provision of issuing citizenship on basis of the birth was however revived. But in the present context, the children of those who obtained citizenship by birth are not given citizenship though guaranteed by the constitution of Nepal.  The high-caste Hindu elites from the hills have perceived those stateless people to be Indians, which is partially true. Some Indian citizens have illegally obtained citizenship in Nepal, but that does not mean the government can restrict millions of its own Nepali citizens from exercising their rights. The government has to arrange strict mechanisms while issuing it.  Patriarchy has been the system of the world. Nepal is obviously not an exception. Women were regarded as objects of men. There had been discrimination in multiple areas on the basis of gender.  In patriarchal Nepal, Nationality and citizenship are traditionally inherited from the father. If a father is either unknown or has moved away, the children are left stateless. They do not get citizenship on the basis of their mother’s name. In 2015, Forum for Women, Law, and Development (FWLD), estimated over 4 million people living in Nepal in a state of statelessness. The number has sharply increased.  Nepal has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ), making itself obliged to end all forms of discrimination against women. Due to a lack of appropriate federal laws, women are discriminated against. This goes against various fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution.",political

House panel agrees to increase the statute of limitations for rape,"Kathmandu, July 8 The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee in the House of Representatives has decided to propose increasing the statute of limitations for rape in the country’s criminal law.

However, the court released the  full text of the verdict  this week,  which says  the government still could go ahead with the Nijgadh airport plan if it was ready to do everything from point zero. The verdict has urged the government to redo the environmental impact assessment and reconsider the area so as to make the minimum adverse impact on the environment. In this context, Minister Shrestha said in a virtual meeting on Thursday, “The confusion about the plan has ended with the full text coming out. Respecting the court, the government has accorded a high priority to this national pride project. Now, we will move it forward.”  The project has turned controversial with  environmentalists protesting  the idea of building a mega airport destroying the habitat of hundreds of flora and fauna.",political

"Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre launch efforts to change Bagmati CM","Kathmandu, June 30 Two parties in the ruling coalition–Nepali Congress and CPN-Maoist Centre–have launched efforts to change the government in the Bagmati province. Although both parties have not spoken anything officially, they have begun collecting signatures of their lawmakers so that they could file a no-confidence motion against Chief Minister Rajendra Pandey anytime.  Both parties are key parts of the  Pandey government  as it was formed out of the alliance among them when no party garnered majority votes in the provincial assembly. But now, the Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre want to change the government leadership citing  Pandey of the CPN-Unified Socialist  had agreed to hand over his position to Indra Bahadur Baniya of the Nepali Congress. As the three parties had agreed to share the Bagmati chief ministership between Pandey and Baniya for equal terms, the parties except his have launched a round of efforts to make the chief minister respect the decision. “We might need to complete this procedure anytime,” a Maoist Centre lawmaker says, “This is the monsoon season and the lawmakers cannot be available on time.

"JSPN to split again as Bhattarai, Yadav agree to break up","Kathmandu, June 30 The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSPN) is splitting again.  The party’s federal council chairperson Dr Baburam Bhattarai and central committee chairperson Upendra Yadav have agreed to break up. Bhattarai and Yadav held a meeting on Wednesday evening, during which Bhattarai proposed parting ways, according to a leader. Yadav also accepted the proposal. A leader close to Yadav says he told Bhattarai that he was not telling anyone to leave the party, but if they wished, he could not stop them. The leaders have agreed to ask their central committee members and lawmakers to choose which side they want to be on. It is likely that the Yadav side will retain the official recognition of the JSPN as it commands the majority. It means the Bhattarai side will have to form a new party.  The party had split in July last year also with the  Mahantha Thakur-led group splitting .",political
"Supreme Court verdict full text: Nijgadh airport is possible, but everything needs to be done from point zero","Kathmandu, June 30 The Supreme Court on Wednesday released the  full text of the verdict  it  handed down last month , telling the government to cancel everything related to the  proposed Nijgadh airport . The full text clarifies the apex court does not rule out the possibility of constructing the airport in Nijgadh of the Bara district in southern Nepal. However, the possibility is still bleak as the government has been told to redo everything from point zero.  The court has pointed out that the Nijgadh airport plan the government was pursuing was detrimental to the local environment there whereas the decision to construct the airport was made even before the environmental impact assessment. Stating that the bench understands the need for another international airport in Nepal, the court says the government can launch a new feasibility study to decide where to construct the airport. The five-member bench, however, was divided in the landmark verdict. The majority–Bishwambhar Prasad Shrestha, Ishwar Prasad Khatiwada, and Prakash Man Singh Raut–told the government to cancel the entire process, two other justices–Hari Krishna Karki and Manoj Kumar Sharma–noted their dissent that the government could continue the process just with a new feasibility study.",political

"Local elections, Balen Shah, and a new political balance for big changes","Local units serve as the foundation for the state, democracy, development, and prosperity. But, how many local governments have made public their accomplishments over the last five years between two local elections? They should have proclaimed their past achievements, performances and expenditures to the public before leaving the offices.  However, most local governments were unable to produce any previous records because they failed to provide good services to the people, which shows a need for improvement in their democratic culture and political integrity. However, the victory of independent candidates such as  Balen Shah in Kathmandu  during the local elections this time has shown a new political culture is being developed, which could be a catalyst to big changes. Various analyses are being conducted in relation to the results of the local elections. The election results have shifted the balance of power between the parties. The UML, which had previously become the first party at the local level, has been forced to shrink into the second party today while the Congress, which had previously been the second party, has been given the opportunity to become the first party. Although the Maoist Centre has made some progress, it still ranks third. The best feature of the local elections this time was that the people did not trust those who were unable to deliver development projects and delayed public services previously; also people allegedly involved in corruption and false promises were also defeated. No matter where the parties came from, in most places, the people were found to have given a lot of thought to voting during the local elections. However, in the place where the alliance was formed, it was found that the leaders and cadres cast their votes for support of the alliance. Many past people’s representatives did not win the elections due to their false promises and lack of contribution to the welfare of the people.  This time, the people did not believe in those leaders who do not have honesty and sincerity for local level developments. Many of the leaders who were chosen as candidates due to the vested personal interests of the senior leaders had a hard time gaining the faith of the people. While in some areas people still vote in the name of the coalition but new and young faces emerged during the local elections this time. The major party, UML, suffered the biggest loss in the local elections. The UML has suffered some losses due to the split in the party and the belief that the UML should be defeated in any way by the alliance of other parties. However, the biggest defeat seems to have been borne by the UML for its own reasons. The party had become the first party after winning 297 municipalities in the 2017 local elections. However, it has never been able to study and analyse the status of the people’s representatives who have won from the UML since then. This was the big mistake of the UML during the five-year period. However, the Congress had to face the same problems, but due to the alliance and getting votes from other parties, the Congress has been able to add many new young faces at local levels even though it has lost some of its old candidates. Another message conveyed by the recent local elections is that a person who lives locally and is engaged in public works and social service can win the elections regardless of their party affiliation. However, the elections seem to have conveyed the message that a person who comes from a leader’s vested interest but has not been able to serve the community, lacks morality and honesty no matter how much they spend finds it very difficult to win the elections. On the other hand, the local elections this time have also given another important message about the attraction of the people towards  independent and young candidates . Independent candidate Balen Shah has secured a position as the mayor of  Kathmandu metropolitan city . Similarly, a few others—Manoj Sah of  Janakpur ,  Gopal Hamal  of  Dhangadhi , and  Harka Rai  of  Dharan — won the local elections as independent candidates.  These results show that the people are highly frustrated with the current political parties and leaders.  The votes they secured are against all forms of hegemony, including partisanship, political bargaining, old party leadership, nepotism, favouritism, the jamindari system in political parties, and the extreme lack of internal democracy. At the same time, respect for diversity, proper use of resources and transparency are highly demanded. It is also in favour of the republic and the federal structure, its institutionalisation and the appropriate reform of the constitution and laws.  Balen Shah’s candidacy for the Kathmandu metropolitan city and the wave he has raised, the new thinking and enthusiasm he has brought and the blow he has inflicted on the syndicate in politics will surely add new dimensions.  Local governments’ success requires the preservation of local identity, the identification and resolution of local needs and problems, and proper coordination with states, federations, and other nations. Similarly, the true meaning of provincial self-government is the preservation of provincial uniqueness, the identification and resolution of needs and problems, and the practical practice of coordination with all.  The independent candidates’ success is all dependent on all of these factors. Let us hope that they will be an example and that his enthusiasm will grow because addressing these issues requires respecting diversity and constructing a prosperous democratic society.",political

Govt to write to US stating it won’t be part of SPP,"Kathmandu, June 21 The government has decided not to be a part of the  United States-led State Partnership Program  (SPP).

Justice is a far cry from reality for sexual violence survivors of the Nepal civil war,"Ms T (name changed) had only turned 16 when Nepal Army arrested her. She had spent two years in the Maoist People’s Liberation Army and was returning home when the government-side army took her to the Ghorahi barracks and committed sexual violence. “They held me captive for three months,” she says. “I feel numb when I think about what I faced at the army camp.” She says that the army tortured her by taking her clothes off and hitting her with the barrel of their gun. They even hit her in her genitals. “They tied me and undressed me. I went through a lot. I used to plead and ask for mercy, but they never listened as they continued to abuse me,” says T. She stayed in the army barracks for three months and further six months in police custody before being released. It has been over 18 years since this incident took place, but for her, it still feels like yesterday. The abuse she faced at the hands of the army still gives her nightmares. “My uterus still hurts from the sexual violence I face there,” she says. “My body also doesn’t function well. I don’t have external bruises, but, mentally, I don’t think I will ever recover.” Ms T says that she has not even been able to share what happened to her with her husband. She does not think she can ever tell him or her kids. Knowing how everyone would treat her, she has kept this to herself for years. “It’s okay I’ve learnt to live with it,” says Ms T, who has also been taking depression medicines. Since the end of the  Nepal civil war  (the Maoist insurgency) in 2006, hundreds of women like her have come forward to share stories of sexual violence torture by the warring parties, but none of them have received justice. Things are so bad that the state does not even consider these women war survivors. According to data, around 17,000 lost their lives, 2,000 went missing and 16,000 were injured in the war between 1996 and 2006. But, these statistics have nothing about the sexual violence women faced during the war.  Sushila Chaudhary, the general secretary of the National Conflict Victim Woman Network, says while the government has addressed some demands of the conflict victims who died, when it comes to women who were abused, the government has not even tried to even take stock of what happened. Even when they do file complaints at the transitional justice bodies, they get no response whatsoever. It was 1999 when a few people claiming to be Maoists broke into the house of Simran (name changed). Her husband was away for work in India and she lived with her six-month-old daughter and four-year-old son. As soon as the Maoists entered, they threatened to kill her if she did not do what they told her to. A few hours later, the group of Maoist fighters raped Simran one by one. “When the first one raped me, I became unconscious. There were five of them and I don’t recall how many times it happened. When I woke up, I was covered in blood,” says Simran. It has been 23 years, yet a certain fear engulfs her whenever she hears the word ‘Maoists’. She gets angry because that incident changed her life. “Due to that incident, my relationship with my husband is not good. When he comes back from India, all we do is a quarrel. I have hurt my uterus too,” she says. The sexual violence incident left both mental and physical marks as she has been diagnosed with depression and has been taking medicines since the incident. The same year in Tulsipur of Dang, another incident shattered the life of another woman. A group of security personnel forced entry into the house of Rita (name changed) and raped her. She was sleeping when a few people force-entered, threatened to kill her and raped her. “It’s been 23 years, but the wounds seem fresh. Whenever I see the police or army personnel, I get scared because of what they did to me,” says Rita.  Like the women above, Rita did not share this story with many people as she fears social banishment. To cope, she is also taking anti-depressants.  But, a few months ago, she mustered the courage to file a written complaint at the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission . But, her case has not moved forward. “All I want the state to do is give me justice and acknowledge me as a war survivor. Is that too much to ask for,” she says. From the above examples, it is clear that the government does not care about sexual violence survivors. The government has to assume how many women were abused during the war based on complaints it gets at the National Human Rights Commission, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.  Even though people who died, got injured or were missing were categorised as war victims, and their families were offered some sort of relief by the government, when it comes to women who were abused, this has not been the case. Chaudhary from the conflict victim network says action should have been taken against culprits who raped these women. But, 15 years on, nothing has happened. “The government hasn’t even tried to ask these women if they are doing okay. Justice is very far away,” says Chaudhary. She says that this also shows how lightly the government takes incidents like sexual violence. “Since they are not categorised as war victims or survivors, they haven’t been eligible for any sort of relief. It shows how insensitive the government is when they can’t do anything to help these women who have been hiding their pain for all these years,” she says. Ms T who was abused in the army barracks says she was treated like an animal there.  “There is so much pain inside people like me who were on the receiving end of some inhumane treatment. It’s only fair that we are compensated,” she says. She says it was disgusting that the government was not treating them as war survivors despite them coming out and sharing what happened to them during the war. This has assured her and others like her that they might never get justice. Sarita (name changed) from Rukum was gang-raped when she was 16. The villagers found her body at a jungle where she had been raped by five Maoist cadres. She is 37 now and has a family. But, none of them know what she has gone through. Her parents know, but she has not been able to share it with her husband or anyone else. She is afraid that if she shares, her husband will leave her. Fearing societal backlash, she has not even reported this case to the authority. Because she was raped when she was young, she is facing problems in her reproductive system. This causes physical pain, but she says she will never share this with her husband because she knows what might happen. In this case, the chances of the survivor getting relief from the government in nonexistent. Both the army and Maoists have raped or abused women during the war. But, with women not wanting to speak out, the actual number of women who were abused will be unknown to all. Things would be different if these survivors were assured justice, but with that not happening, it is unlikely anyone will come forward, say women rights activists. “These women have families and children. They fear that if they open up about what happened two decades ago, everyone in the society will know and her children and family will have to face the wrath. It’s a no-win situtation for these women,” says Chaudhary. Women of all ages were subject to sexual violence during the war.  Most of these incidents took place when the army and police went patrolling in the villages where they felt there were Maoist fighters. In 2005, a six-year-old girl was raped by Nepal Army personnel in Rukum. The child, now 24, says how the incident still haunts her mentally. She even got ill following the incident as she still suffers pain in her abdomen and lower back. “There are so many incidents like these where patrols have forcefully entered and abused women here in Rukum,” says Prakash Chaudhary, the chairman of conflict victim network in Dang. He says that the army took women accusing them of being Maoists and tortured them. “The army raped a lot of women accusing them of being Maoists. The number of women they abused is crazy,” he says. There was even a case when a woman who went looking for her husband who died in the war was raped by the army. “The woman even gave birth to a child out of that rape. But, she’s facing issues and is looking at how she can give the child a citizenship certificate,” he says. Prakash Chaudhary says that even though some of these sexual violence complaints were reported, the government has done nothing because both – the state and the Maoists – are not willing to accept that these sexual abuses and rapes were war crimes. Simran from Tulsipur filed a complaint at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2017. But, her case is yet to be heard. “It’s odd why they are not willing to accept that we are war survivors. This is wrong at many levels,” says Simran. Following the peace process, two commissions were formed to deal with these cases. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was responsible for finding out the truth about incidents of gross violation of human rights in the course of armed conflict while the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons was formed to seek the truth on the cases of enforced disappearance, to recommend reparation to victims and prosecution to the accused ones. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has over 64,000 complaints from war survivors. The commission’s spokesperson Man Dhakal says there are over 300 cases related to sexual violence, but he adds that this is not the exact data because he knows that a lot of women have no come forward. “These women who faced sexual violence have said they were physically abused instead. When we looked into it, we find that almost all physical violence cases are actually sexual violence cases,” says Dhakal, adding physical violence cases have crossed 20,000. According to the Women’s Rehabilitation Centre (WOREC), there are over 300 sexual violence cases in Rukum alone. And, these are only those cases where the women have come forward. WOREC also says that many of the women abused during the war have not come forward. Maina Karki, an activist, says women have not come forward because the state bodies are not sensitive. “These women need to be looked at differently. Its been 15 years since the peace process, yet these women are not at peace. If people were more sensitive and willing to listen without judgement, more women would definitely come forward, but right now, they don’t because most of them are scared and don’t trust anyone,” says Karki. Even the government agrees that women who faced sexual violence have not received any relief from the government. The state offered a million rupees to families of people who died or went missing in the war while it has been handing out relief allowance to those injured in the war.  Survivors of 17 other incidents have also received some form or relief allowance from the state, but women who were raped have not received a penny. Nor have they received counselling or anything thing else. According to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Rs 17.26 billion was handed out as relief or allowance to 1.3 million war survivors in the fiscal year 2017/18. But, not a penny went to women who were abused. Dhakal says that they had recommended the relief for these sexual violence survivors after doing their due research, but nothing has been offered to them yet. “We studied over 500 cases and asked the ministry to hand them relief allowance. But, our recommendation hasn’t been taken by the ministry yet,” says Dhakal.",political
Oli govt had asked the US to let Nepal join the State Partnership Program in 2015,"Kathmandu, June 16 Amid the ongoing debate about the United States government’s  State Partnership Program , it has been found that the KP Sharma Oli-led government had asked for the program back in 2015. Earlier, the CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal had claimed it was Oli who had taken initiatives for the program. But, Oli’s CPN-UML has refuted the charge, challenging Dahal to show evidence.

Govt rules out Nepal in US State Partnership Program yet again,"Kathmandu, June 16 The government reiterates Nepal will not be a part of the United States government’s controversial State Partnership Program.  Earlier this week, some media  leaked the proposed draft  of the partnership agreement that said some US security personnel could stay in Nepal for an indefinite period. The leak sparked protests inside the parliament and on social media. In response to the lawmakers’ queries regarding the project during the House of Representatives on Thursday, Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand on behalf of the prime minister, said, “Nepal is not involved in the State Partnership Program. Neither do we have any thoughts about it.”  Earlier, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has also already  clarified to the ruling alliance  that he would not sign the State Partnership Project agreement during his US visit expected to be held next month.",political

"After protests, Deuba clarifies he won’t sign the US-proposed State Partnership Program","Kathmandu, June 15 As the draft agreement for the US-proposed  State Partnership Program  got criticised by several political parties and the public, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has clarified he will not sign the deal during his visit to Washington, DC, to be held next month. During a meeting with CPN-Maoist Centre and CPN-Unified Socialist chairmen Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal respectively, Deuba he would not sign the agreement now.  “Last night, the three had a long discussion about the topic,” a source close to the prime minister says, “The meeting concluded that forwarding this project would keep the ruling coalition in jeopardy. Hence, the prime minister withdrew.” It has been learned that the three leaders met and discussed the topic today also.  Meanwhile, leaders of Deuba’s Nepali Congress party have also agreed to not discuss the issue further.

US State Partnership Program: Here’s the draft of the deal that lets US personnel stay in Nepal indefinitely,"Kathmandu, June 14 The United States government has floated a proposal for a State Partnership Program to be signed between the US Department of Defense and the Nepali Ministry of Defence that also includes letting some members of the US security forces stay in Nepal for an indefinite period. After the draft of the proposed agreement came to notice, the stipulated visit of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to Washington, DC, has been drawn into controversy. Even some members of the ruling alliance have sought clarifications from the prime minister about the agreements the two countries will sign. Apparently, the US officials, in their  recent engagements  here, are putting pressure on Nepali counterparts to sign the agreement as soon as possible.

"With the US getting more active, Nepal is on the verge of a shift in its foreign relations","After a month of United States Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights and  US Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues ,  Uzra Zeya’s visit , another US official has come to Nepal.  On Thursday last week, the commanding general of the  US Army Pacific , General  Charles Flynn ,  arrived in Nepal . The visit of a US General created added tension to Nepal’s dynamic foreign relations amidst the whole  MCC controversy. These two were not the only Americans to visit the country. In the past year, many US state officials have come to Nepal and met the country’s top leaders. It seems Nepal is doing a lot to improve foreign relations, in particular, with the US, and vice versa.  Taking that into consideration, a few lawmakers are asking the government to explain why so many US officials are coming to Nepal. UML leader Bhim Rawal and CPN-Maoist Centre’s Giriraj Mani Pokharel on Thursday posted questions in the parliament if Nepal was on the verge of joining the US-led  Indo-Pacific Strategy . They are right to suspect this as there has been no briefing on why these officials are coming to Nepal for. On February 27, the House of Representatives  ratified the Millenium Challenge Corporation compact . Since then, different US officials have been vising Nepal. The compact was passed by the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government, which has also been trying its best to get to the US as possible.  Khadak KC, a professor at the  Tribhuvan University’s  Department of International Relations and Diplomacy, hints things have changed in terms of relations between Nepal and the US since the MCC was ratified. “It seems the MCC and the Indo-Pacific aren’t as far away from each other as we were told. If the MCC was purely a development project, why are so many US officials coming to the country all of a sudden? This does show there’s been a change in Nepal’s foreign relations,” says KC. But, the US has time and again said that its presence in Nepal is only for development purposes along with human rights. But, as KC speculates, there is more to this than meets the eye. He believes the US wants to get Nepal into the Indo-Pacific strategy and in the long run, use it to pressurise China. Zeya even met with Tibetan refugees while US Ambassador to Nepal Randy Berry went to  upper Mustang to visit the monasteries there . This will surely have a negative impact on Nepal’s balanced foreign relations as it could hurt the  relationship with its northern neighbour, China . “People who don’t have experience are handling diplomacy and that is why this is happening. This will take a bad turn someday,” says the former ambassador and foreign relations expert, Deep Kumar Upadhayay. It has been 75 years since Nepal-US relations started and both parties claim that these visits are mostly to do with celebrating this. But, the director of the  Centre for South Asian Studies , Nischal Nath Pandey, says the visits also prove that the US trusts PM Sher Bahadur Deuba. “A high-level official hadn’t come to Nepal in over two decades. It shows they trust this government, hence so many officials have come since Deuba took office,” says Pandey. It has been two decades since a Nepali prime minister has been invited by the US. Back then, it was Deuba who was invited by the US government and fast forward 20 years, Deuba again has been invited by the US government. This shows how much the US trusts Deuba. Following  Deuba becoming prime minister  nearly a year ago,  MCC’s vice-president Fatema Z Sumar came to Nepal  and met almost all Nepali officials.  After Sumar, Donald Lu,  the United States assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs and Kelly Keiderling, deputy assistant secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs came to Nepal  and met Deuba and other leaders. A high-level team led by  US senator Kristen Gillibrand  also visited Nepal in April. During this period, Nepal did not see any high-profile visit from either India or China, its closest neighbours. Deuba,  when he went to India for a three-day visit , did ask the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to come to Nepal. Modi accepted his invitation and  came to Nepal to celebrate Buddha Jayanti  in May. But, Modi did not come to Kathmandu as he flew into and out of Lumbini. Before Deuba went to India,  China’s Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi  visited Nepal. These are the only two high-level visits made by Indian and Chinese officials in the 11 months since Deuba became prince minister. “We can’t say no if a foreign official wants to come to Nepal,” says a member of the House of Representatives, Deepak Prakash Bhatta. “Once they arrive, we have to follow the foreign policy and look after them.” These visits made by the US have also affected the decision-making process of the leaders in the country, claim foreign policy experts. They say these visits have pressurised the ruling parties into taking decisions in haste. Take the MCC ratification for example. Many believe MCC’s-vice president Sumar came to Nepal to pressurise the Nepali leaders into ratifying the compact. The pressure intensified when Lu came to Nepal, after which Deuba, despite protest by the opposition, tried to table the MCC compact in the parliament. Dueba was even ready to break the coalition and pass the compact. But, the Maoist and the Unified Socialist parties accused Deuba of threatening them after which, Deuba took the help of the  12-point interpretative declaration  and created an environment to pass the compact. When Zeya came to Nepal, she did not meet any top leaders. As soon as she landed in Kathmandu, she went to a Tibetan refugee camp. How China will take this is a different issue as it is keeping a close eye on Tibetan refugees in Nepal. Even though there’s a general consensus that China is doing wrong to Tibetans, Nepal’s foreign policy has accepted the One China policy. The home and foreign ministries were unaware that Zeya was going to visit these camps.  A source at the foreign ministry says that China is not happy regarding this.  Former ambassador Upadhyay says that the government dealing with the issue was dangerous for the country in the long run. “They tried to rub it under the carpet, which in the long run will be bad,” says Upadhyay. “China is looking at this and ambassadors and other officials visiting these camps will not be received well.” A source tells Onlinekhabar that Zeya even asked Nepali officials to provide the refugees with cards identifying them as refugees as she was told how they were restricted from exercising basic human rights. The government stopped handing out these cards in 1995, but the US has for a while been asking Nepal to start giving the refugees the ID card. Flynn’s visit is also seen negatively by some. Flynn comes to Nepal before Deuba’s visit to the US. Nepal’s Chief of Army Staff  Prabhu Ram Sharma is also going to the US . Flynn has asked Nepal  to join the US-led  State Partnership Program  (SSP), which the US has wanted Nepal to be a part of since 2015. But, since the SSP is part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, Nepal has not signed. CPN-UML’s Bhim Rawal, on Thursday, had called on the government to explain why Flynn was coming to Nepal. He asked if the government was planning to be a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy.  Maoist Centre’s Giriraj Mani Pokharel asked if the government was planning to sign the State Partnership Program agreement. “I heard this from a source. Is this true? The government has to answer,” he said at the House of Representatives on Thursday. But, security and foreign relations expert Binoj Basnet says people are taking things out of hand as this might only be a formal visit of a country as the general was in India. Basnet, who served in the Nepal Army, says Flynn may be visiting as the US had only recently finalised the Indo-Pacific Strategy and maybe he was going around Asia to make it public to the countries around the region. The US has also been providing Nepal’s army with training and building its capacity to go work with UN peacekeepers. The two countries are also sharing experiences in mountain warfare, jungle warfare and anti-terrorism. They are also teaching Nepal Army about intelligence sharing and dealing with natural disasters. Nepal for a long time has been adhering to the non-alignment policy as far as its foreign relations are concerned. But, in recent times, the country’s foreign policy has been questioned by many leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties. KP Sharma Oli, Pradeep Gyawali, Jhala Nath Khanal and Narayan Kaji Shrestha all have been questioning the country’s foreign policy. They accused the government of not bettering foreign relations with neighbours and condemned how the  government protested Russia  on invading Ukraine when it could have remained mum. Oli even questioned why the government has not put the  Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)  on this programme and policy and questioned if Nepal’s policy on foreign relations has changed. Nepal did not bring the BRI even when Wang Yi came to Nepal. Even though some communist leaders asked for the BRI to be endorsed, Deuba and Foreign Minister Narayan Khadka have not been interested.  This story was translated from  the original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

"Nepal wants new universities one after another, leaving old ones in the lurch","In the fiscal year 2021/22, the government set a budget of Rs 18.18 billion for universities across the country. But, this amount was half of what the universities had asked for.  The  University Grants Commission  says that the amount the government invests in universities is woeful every time. But, wait, the government is allowing the formation of more universities. Although the constitution has given all education-related rights only to the Education Ministry, ministries like health, defence, tourism and sports have started initiatives to establish their own new universities. While experts say these new universities might produce the skilled human resources the country needs, a lack of research on how it will be managed badly worries them as the current condition of universities is in a dire state. “Due to the incompetence of the political leadership and the weakness of the people they recruit, there is now a possibility of a university for each ministry,” says educationist Bidya Nath Koirala. “This shouldn’t be happening, but seems it will.” A year ago, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation prepared a bill and sent it to the Council of Ministers to open a hotel management and tourism university called Dim University with the minister of tourism as its pro-chancellor. The bill states that the university can only run education programmes and not hand out affiliations. Despite the bill being sent to the cabinet, it did not move forward after then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel voiced his concerns. But, the bill is still with the Council of Ministers. Similarly, there are also plans to set up National Defence University (NDU) under the watch of the Nepal Army and start its first session from 2023-24. The government has already given the green light and announced it had given a budget during the 2019-20 fiscal year. Nepal Army’s spokesperson Narayan Silwal says the university would teach subjects related to national security.  “We aim to teach Nepali Army and Armed Police Force subjects related to defence, home affairs and financial security,” he says. Under the social studies and research academy of the university, work has been started so that the general public including the army can study. Professors and graduates of National Defence University, professors of colleges, experts of research centres, professors and those working in certain faculties will be its resource persons. Similarly, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has also allocated funds for the establishment of a sports university and is conducting a feasibility study through Tribhuvan University. According to the ministry, the sports university will focus on various subjects surrounding sports. However, the ministry says everything will be clear only after the study report comes out. The ministry’s spokesperson Bidur Prasad Khanal says that the ministry expected the feasibility study report in April but, it has not received it yet. The country currently has 12 universities. And almost all of them are in a dire state.  Tribhuvan University , the oldest university in the country, is miserable. According to the University Grants Commission’s report published on November 23, 2021, there are less than 100 students in each of 510 education institutions under the university. Similarly, according to the commission, there are 290 educational institutions with less than 100 pupils. But, without any prior planning, new universities are being founded. There are no established affiliation requirements or a proper roadmap for making suggestions for their establishment focusing on resource management for sustainability. The report of the commission shows there is a shortage of students in the existing universities. The 12 universities in the country have a total of 466,828 students. Of them, 76.40 per cent or 356,654 students are studying at Tribhuvan University. The university has 1,437 colleges across the country. Almost all existing universities are all multidisciplinary universities except the University of Agriculture and Forest Sciences, Nepal Sanskrit University and Lumbini Buddhist University. But, due to a lack of students, the Sanskrit and Lumbini Buddhist universities have also started teaching other subjects for sustainability. If you look at the pass percentage, the situation is dire as only 29.3 per cent of students studying at TU pass their bachelor’s, master’s and PhD levels. Many argue that the universities are performing badly due to political appointments. As the government changes, so do these officials, and that hampers the ongoing reforms in the universities if there are any. Then, every party’s student unions look for a cut and if their demands are not met, they raise an education issue and padlock offices.  The TU is a prime example of this. Sudan Poudel, the executive director of the Nepal Sanskrit University Research Centre, says the proposed new universities will not be any different from existing universities if the government does not do anything to change them. “The university structure needs to be reformed. Until that happens, we can open as many universities as we want; nothing will change,” says Poudel. No one knows how many universities are needed in Nepal because the government has not done any research on their actual requirement. Then, there is no systematic study on which university is capable of producing the required human resource and where the human resources produced by the universities are being consumed. “The government has to do this basic research before allowing permission for new universities to establish. It’s useless to open any university without knowing the benefit it will give to the country,” says Tilak Ram Acharya, the registrar of the Lumbini Buddhist University. Former Education Secretary Gopinath Mainali says there has been no study on the need for new universities in Nepal and how it is going to work for everyone’s benefit. “Research on the need for universities is the first thing that the government should do,” says Mainali. According to Mainali, the need for new universities should be examined from several angles. To begin with, it should be examined from the perspective of the number of universities required in Nepal, as well as their contribution. Second, from the perspective of national human resource development or human resource development, and third, from the perspective of the global trend. Only after such research, he claims, will it be evident how many new universities the country requires. Similar views were expressed by educationist Bidya Nath Koirala. “We need to know which region’s universities will be run and by which government. We should also consider whether they will be private or operate on a private-public partnership basis,” Koirala says. Other education experts say there also needs to be a discussion on the curricula. The universities in the country have also been accused of producing students who are not capable of critical analysis.  A member of the development committee formed to prepare the infrastructures of  Nepal University , Amina Singh, says, “We believe that a university should produce students with a critical mind. We think the curriculum and teaching style should be different for producing such students.” Educationist Susan Acharya says new universities would not be facing a shortage in students if they opened after due research. She believes the country does not need new universities anymore.  “Based on Nepal’s population, we don’t need any more universities. If they open one, it’ll only be for political gain,” she says. After all, as mentioned, above even universities for specific subjects are bound to teach other subjects for sustainability.  “No one can guarantee that new universities will be any different than TU or any other university in Nepal,” says Acharya. “If we really want to create an environment, we should hire competent people. The posts should be filled based on competition. Even the vice-chancellor should be incorporated in this way. Political appointments should stop. If we can try that with the TU and implement it elsewhere, I’m sure things will change.”  Bidya Nath Koirala says that rather than establishing new universities, the government should instead decentralise the TU and have one campus in each province. This, he believes, will be beneficial for both the teachers and the students. But, Ganesh Man Gurung, the chancellor of the Gandaki University, believes new universities should open according to the demand. He does, however, assert the new universities are identical to those already in operation. He claims that thorough research should be carried out prior to the opening of universities, but there is a need for more than that. “There hasn’t been any research done on higher education in a long time. I believe we should start there and then figure out where we fall short and where we excel. Only then, we will be able to determine what students want to study and what colleges must provide for them,” says former TU VC Kedar Bhakta Mathema, who believes that this will aid in the establishment of new universities. Even the chair of the University Grants Commission, Bhim Prasad Subedi, agrees that the country has not been able to do research on what new universities actually are needed. “We discuss that we need to do research, but nothing has been done so far,” says Subedi.

Chure region is the target of greedy officials once again,"The government has once again introduced a plan to extract and process stones and pebbles despite the Supreme Court’s  order  on June 18, 2021. In point number 124 of the new  budget plan , it is mentioned that the  Department of Mines and Geology  will start the extraction of marble, granite, and precious metals like iron, stone, and rock from the potential locations identified in the Mahabharata region, after environmental assessment. However, the department itself is not clear about the said plan. The spokesperson of the department, Narayan Baskota, says that they have no extraction plan. He further informs that the department is making efforts to understand the budget plan, adding, “Perhaps the government plans to conduct a feasibility study and that is why it has made such an announcement.” Secretary at the Industry and Commerce Ministry Ganesh Prasad Pandey says the plan will have to await the environmental and feasibility as well as investment studies before it will be implemented. Neither is there a law that encourages coordination among the three tiers of government regarding the conservation and systematic use of natural resources as well as its budget. As it is not the ministry’s proposal, there is still a long way to go, he adds. Conservationists and environmentalists, on the other hand, fear that once again the plan is to exploit the country’s natural resources, destroy the Chure region and desertify the Terai region, just like what the previous Oli government had planned. The budget for the current fiscal year 2021/22, announced by the KP Sharma Oli-led government, had announced the extraction of stone, pebbles, and sand. In the  plan announced in an ordinance  on May 29 last year, it was mentioned that the trade deficit would be reduced by extracting stones and pebbles.  But, it faced a widespread protest including that from the opposition alliance. The alliance had argued the incumbent government was favouring the decision to appease the southern neighbour, India, and stay in power. In a joint statement, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal,  CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal Chairman Upendra Yadav and Rastriya Janamorcha Vice-chairperson Durga Paudel had stated, “It is a declaration of treason and genocide where the lives of common people will be put in endangerment with flood and drying up of water resources.” Yet the Oli government had claimed the Chure region would not be destroyed. Whereas the then Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel tried to stop the protest by claiming that he was committed to the protection of the Chure region, adding the extraction only from the mines in the Mahabharat region. Subsequently, seven writ petitions were filed at the Supreme Court claiming the extraction would desert Terai and exploit the fundamental rights. Hence, the court put a halt to the plan stating the government was exploiting the available natural resources in the Chure region in the name of reducing the budget deficit.  The decision was made by a bench of the then Chief Justice  Cholendra Shamsher Rana , justices Deepak Kumar Karki, Meera Khadka, Hari Krishna Karki and Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha. But, despite knowing the court’s decision, an official of the Ministry of Finance says the recent decision to resume extraction in the Chure region was made to serve the interests of a limited group.  A source from the Ministry of Commerce claims the interest group has once again made plans to extract the stones and pebbles from the Chure region in this year’s budget as well. He adds they claim to excavate not from the region but from 92 mines outside it where the environmental impact assessment has been done.  But, interestingly, most of the mines identified are located around Chure, Bhavar, Siwalik and other river systems that include the areas around Dhankuta, Lalitpur, Morang, Makawanpur, Palpa, Arghakhanchi, Chitwan, Doti, Dadeldhura, Pyuthan, Surkhet, Salyan, Sindhuli and Udaypur. Earlier, as the mines were in the forest areas, the Department of Mines and Geology was not able to issue licences for extraction. This year, the extraction announcement was included under the Ministry of Forests. The official claims it confirms that there is a vested interest at play to issue the licences and extract the resources. “Given the lack of clear laws and policies, it is more complicated. The interest group wants to export local resources from the Chure region to India.” According to Vijay Kumar Singh Danuwar, a former member of the Chure Terai-Madhesh Conservation and Development Committee and a Chure region expert, there is an evident risk of destruction of the Mahabharat and Chure regions in the long run. According to experts, one of the low hills in the Mahabharat range that stretches east-west is the Chure/ Shivalik hills. It was formed about 40 million years ago by the accumulation of gravel in the middle of geological cracks. The Chure region is spread over 37 districts from Ilam in the east to Kanchanpur in the west. The Chure landmass is considered to be unique and sensitive to natural and ecological systems. The Chure region is considered to be highly sensitive due to its fragile topography, poor soil nature, loss of biodiversity and short-term heavy rainfall. However, expert Danuwar says the activities taking place in the Mahabharat mountain range above Chure are also connected with Chure and Terai Madhesh regions. “Excavating the mountains of the Mahabharat range produces only 25 to 30 per cent of exportable stone and pebbles, and the remaining 70 to 75 per cent of the debris flows into the Terai region,” he says. Environmentalist and Chure region expert Vinod Bhatt expresses concerns that the government has brought a programme similar to last year’s plan by twisting the words. He adds that it would be unfortunate for the country if the plan to export stone from mines in the Chure region was taken forward. He accuses the government of not following the right path at a time when many development works need to be done in the country and proper management of stone and pebbles are required for that. “Projects about the environment are only limited in their political speeches. But, when it comes to money and business, our political parties agree,” he says. This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Cabinet reshuffle plan put on hold after ruling parties’ agreement,"Kathmandu, June 6 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has put on hold the suggestion from the ruling alliance member CPN- Unified Socialist for a cabinet reshuffle .  The Unified Socialist party had recommended five new names to be inducted into the cabinet by replacing its five ministers. Whereas the recommendation was made on Sunday afternoon, Deuba was yet to approve that. But, before that, some “outgoing” ministers reportedly expressed their dissatisfaction with the PM. Ultimately, top leaders of the ruling parties held a meeting on Monday morning and decided to not reshuffle the cabinet now. A source says the coalition decided to put on hold the cabinet reshuffle suggestion citing the House of Representatives is currently discussing the  new budget plan .  Referring to Prime Minister Deuba, one of the ministers reported as removed yesterday says, “He said nothing would change before the budget plan is endorsed. He has asked us to continue the job.”",political
Govt still hesitates to remove the statute of limitations for rape notwithstanding pressure,"Kathmandu, June 6 The government says it will not immediately remove the statute of limitations for rape and sexual violence cases as demanded by the activists and other stakeholders. Following  the revelation of an eight-year-old rape case  by a beauty pageant organiser recently, there is  mounting pressure on the government  to make reforms. Both houses of the federal parliament have  received resolution motions  urging the government to remove the limitation. According to the  National Penal Code Act  2017, chapter 18, section 229 (2), the Statute of Limitations, a rape case must be filed within a year of the occurrence if the survivor is an adult, and within a year of the survivor turning 18 if the survivor is a minor. But, speaking in the House of Representatives meeting on Monday, Law and Justice Minister Govinda Bandi says the government will wait for a report from the  Nepal Law Commission  about the issue before making a decision about the statute of limitations. “The government is serious about your sentiments that no one should be deprived of justice. Therefore, the government has directed the commission to launch a study into it as soon as the public debate started.” “Once the report comes in, the government will make necessary reforms,” he assured.",political

Women’s leadership: Why local elections 2022 are forgettable,"The  local elections  in Nepal are almost over; all but one local unit’s  result  is yet to come out. Many had hoped that the elections this time would be different for women. But, even though their numbers have increased, their representation is found to be declining. In the 2017 elections, only seven women had become mayors of various cities, but this year 13 have won the mayoral elections in their respective municipalities. In rural municipalities, 11 women had become chairs in 2017. This year, that number has gone up to 12.  If you look at it from a leadership point of view, this is positive. But, political analysts say that when it came to women’s representation, it was not what people had expected. “The women who have been elected in the leadership roles are those elected in the deputy role in the last elections. Their development and willingness to work put them in the position to take up leadership positions,” says senior advocate Usha Malla Pathak. But, she argues she did not see the level of enthusiasm seen in the 2017 local elections as not many women gave in their names for leadership roles. “I think political parties didn’t want to see any woman. The parties not giving them space is very sad to see,” says Pathak.  One reason for the lack of women’s interest in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair is the coalition between Nepali Congress,  Maoist Centre , CPN-Unified Socialist, JSPN and Rashtriya Janamorcha. Compared to last year, the number of women in deputy positions was low at 138. In 2017, a total of 700 women had been elected either as deputy mayor or vice-chair. But, this year, only 562 were elected for these posts. This shows their representation has gone down even though the year saw seven more mayors and eight more ward chairs than in 2017. If you look at the percentage of these figures, things are quite dire. Only 25 women became chairs of rural municipalities or mayors. This is only 3.34 per cent, nearly 1 per cent more than the last elections. As usual, the leadership roles have been dominated by men. The number of women in the posts of deputy mayor and vice-chair has gone down. In 2017, 276 had become deputy mayors. This year, only 226 were elected. When it comes to rural municipality vice-chairs, the number has gone down too as only 335 women were elected compared to 424 in 2017.  While women covered 93 per cent of the deputies and vice-chairpersons, this time, only 75 per cent of these seats are occupied by them. “Men dominate political parties and always want to stake their claim when it comes to power position. Plus this year, due to the coalition, the representation has been even low. When the number of female candidates was low, the representation going down is normal,” says Pathak, who believes political parties used a loophole in Nepal’s law by not giving in names of women for the positions of deputies.” Nepal has 6,743 wards. On average, 69 wards have got one woman ward chair this time. This is only a 1.02 per cent representation.  In 2017, the situation was even dire as only 61 women won after contesting for ward chairs. If you look at things on a whole, out of the 34,888 positions up for grabs, women were elected in 14,379 positions. But, this number is just high because of the mandatory rule of having  two female (one Dalit) member s each in wards. If you take that away, only 1,096 women were elected. Yet, the number was low this year, as in many wards, there were  not enough female candidates , especially from the Dalit communities. CPN-UML won in 204 local units. But, out of these, only 10 women were elected. This is a mere 4.09 per cent. Similarly, it won 237 deputy and vice-chair seats, where 213 women were elected. Nepali Congress won the leadership in 326 local units, where only nine women were elected. When it comes to deputy mayors and vice-chairs, Nepali Congress won 298 seats, where 225 women were elected. The Maoist Centre won 121 seats, but only four of them are women.  Only 63 women were elected deputy chairs as the Maoist Centre won 128 seats.

Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah meets PM Deuba,"Kathmandu, June 1 Balen Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu, met Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.

Suman Sayami: Why losing the Kathmandu mayoral election became a victory for this man,"An independent candidate became  Kathmandu ‘s mayor for the first time as  Balen Shah beat  Sirjana Singh from Nepali Congress and UML’s Keshav Sthapit in the recently concluded local elections. There were hundreds of people who attended his victory rally. But, out of everyone there, one man stood apart: a fellow competitor during Shah’s mayoral election — another independent candidate Suman Sayami. “It’s great that someone as young as Balen has become Kathmandu’s mayor. I think it is. This is a win for people who wanted change. Balen has my full support,” says Sayami, adding he and Shah have a lot in common. Now, Suman Sayami hopes Balen Shah will change things and keeps promises that he has made to the public about conserving the valley’s culture and tradition while creating change in how things worked in the country’s largest metropolis. Even though Suman Sayami had not been active in politics, he got over 13,000 votes. Despite not being active in politics, he has served the people of the country in a different way. For over 10 years, he has been a social activist shedding light on issues relating to heritage, culture and civil rights. He was also a key person in the  Guthi Bill movement . “I’m someone who believes in work than talking. I don’t know how to speak to the public, which is why I wasn’t able to tell the public what I had done in the past,” he says. Suman Sayami believes that he got over 13,000 votes due to Kathmandu’s core area, which involves areas occupied by the Newas. “They know what I’ve done in the past, but sadly I couldn’t reach more people because I just didn’t have the time,” he adds. He believes that he was aiming for more votes. In his estimation, he thought he would get between 20,000-25,000 votes. But, he is not disheartened as he takes the 13,770 as a positive step in his political career, which he says, has just started. This means Suman Sayami is not going to stop. He is never going to. “I used to think politics is a dirty game. But I realised that if people like me didn’t get into it and change it, nothing would change.” He started getting vocal around 2015 when the state came to destroy his ancestral house in Kalimati in the name of road expansion. His home was built before the Panchayat era and was a safe space for all the communist leaders who held meetings conspiring on how to overthrow the Panchayat system. When he saw the state was going to demolish his house, he could not withstand it. Suman Sayami, who would usually be at the back of the protests, was at the front and centre then. He could not see the state destroy the house where he grew up. “They told me they had orders from above. That didn’t make sense because the house was legally owned by my family.” Whenever there was a public holiday, he would get anxious. With every government office shut down, every time, he would face different issues on how to stop the excavators from destroying his home. Sayami then started to speak to others like him and moved for a legal solution. They started talking to people from the Kalanki area whose houses were demolished in the name of development. “The state didn’t deploy the excavator to destroy our houses. They deployed to destroy us because, for many people, the house was all they had. Where would these people go? This was nothing but a crime against humanity against us by the Nepal government.” Their campaign turned into a movement and soon Suman Sayami was at the Supreme Court. The court ruled in their favour. But still not satisfied, they even moved to the international courts. It was only after the issue went international that the homes of Sayami and others were saved. He knew that if the government could take away a citizen’s legal home, it could do anything and that paved the way for him to work to save the valley’s heritage and culture. He even formed forums and collected like-minded people to fight against the government. He was everywhere, from protests against the proposed Guthi Bill to the building of the Kathmandu-Terai fast track that would take away land from the farmers of Khokona. He played a role in the  Occupy Tundikhel campaign  that raised awareness about the importance of open green spaces in the valley. “The state wants to finish the history of Kathmandu in the name of development. They even tried to finish the guthis. I couldn’t sit and watch them do this,” he says. Suman Sayami’s father Jivan Raj Manandhar was a communist leader and people told him he should join a communist party too. But, he did not want to. He felt that if he joined a party, he would be no different. He felt it would be against his principle. But, he felt he needed to get into politics only to frame policies about things that the government was not addressing. “I didn’t want to become a mayor. But, when I saw the party representatives, I felt sick and gave in my name,” he says. “I’m someone who understands the local level because I’ve worked there I felt I could be a good mayor.” But, Suman Sayami agrees that he gave in his candidacy a little too late. Not being a part of any public discussions programme also did not help him get more votes. “I thought what I had done in the past would be enough to convince people but I’m not sad because change has won this election,” says Sayami. But, he has not lost hope as he now plans to contest the parliamentary elections and hopes people will vote for him then.

Sunil Prajapati explains why Bhaktapur embraces a ‘permanent power’ every election,"Sunil Prajapati, the recently elected mayor, is in his second innings as the mayor of  Bhaktapur . The votes he received during the recently held  local elections  reflected the trust he acquired from the locals of Bhaktapur municipality. In this election, Prajapati secured 29,252 votes while his closest rival CPN-UML’s Ranjana Kharbuja garnered 2,988 votes. The number of votes Prajapati secured is a reflection of his success in his first tenure. Bhaktapur has a unique history as far as elections are concerned. From local to federal elections, the only party–Nepal Workers’ and Peasants’ Party (NWPP)–secures victory in this ancient town. All big political players in the country hardly find their followers in Bhaktapur. Many people are surprised to see the trend, but Mayor Prajapati says this is not strange.  Onlinekhabar recently held a conversation with Mayor Sunil Prajapati in which he shares his experience and challenges in his previous tenure along with plans for his second tenure. He also highlights why his party achieves landslide victory in every election in Bhaktapur.   In our earlier tenure, we fulfilled all the promises made to the public. The public is also very happy with us. The result clearly shows this as we received nine times more votes than the nearest rival. This certainly means we were able to satisfy the locals. During the interviews, prior to the election, I had also publicly said that the maximum number of votes will be cast for Nepal Workers’ and Peasants’ Party (NWPP). Then, the work we did in different sectors such as health, education and waste management made the voters believe in us one more time making us victorious. Even, the committed voters of other parties believed in us and our commitment to developing the Bhaktapur municipality. The locals trust us because we have always served the public with true hearts. The only thing that the candidates of NWPP have learnt is to serve the public with loyalty. Politics is just about serving the people; it is not a money-making profession. If somebody has to earn money, rather than join politics, they should start doing business. As we are completely devoted to serving people, they believe in us more than other existing political parties.  No, we are not limited. Some of our friends have even won the elections in the western part of the country in places such as Kalikot and Jumla.  The candidates of other parties spend millions of money on the elections, but we are totally against it because we compete for the ideologies. Unless the public becomes ideologically aware, a faithful candidate like us will be unable to win the elections. But, we want to disperse our vision and ideologies throughout the country and for that, we have been working for awareness among the public.  In renovation works, we mobilised the locals. In the last tenure, altogether 124 works of renovation were completed while dozens of sites and buildings are still in the process of renovation. The reason we appointed locals for the renovation is they have skills and are well aware of the local resources that are essential for the renovation of those cultural sites. They have a strong attachment to those cultural sites so they will not compromise on maintaining their originality. We also wanted to spend the budget of the municipality on the public. Doing so would even provide an employment opportunity for the locals. This would also improve the relationship between the public and the municipality.  There were many challenges in Bhaktapur. But among them, the main challenge was the scarcity of drinking water. But, recently, the  water from the Melamchi river  has reached Bhaktapur. Now, we have been successful to distribute the drinking water in every household and overcome the biggest challenge of Bhaktapur.  All these five years, we put in continuous effort for the availability of drinking water, and now, finally, we made it happen.  There are still a lot of things. Some of them are parking management,  renovation of Hyakunche Durbar, Thantu Durbar and Jagannath area, excavation of Unansaya Chok and many others. For the issue of parking, we are planning to make parking areas in various new places.  Likewise, we also haven’t been fully able to use the public land. We also want to improve the nightlife of Bhaktapur so that tourists would even love to visit Bhaktapur during nighttime as well. Locals have been demanding these things since the beginning of my tenure. We are trying our best on it but as these things need a huge amount of budget, we will start working on it after collaborating with the central and provincial governments.  From the beginning, we were mainly concerned about reducing the waste that is usually produced by households. So, for that, firstly, we adopted the proper waste segregation method. Secondly, to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste, we provided training on  rooftop gardening  and composting to each house. Thirdly, we also distributed dustbins in every house.  The locals made compost using the biodegradable waste and used it in their own rooftop farming or selling them to others. Likewise, we also buy non-biodegradable waste.  Loyalty is the most important thing that every municipality should consider while fulfilling its responsibilities. We have been transparent and loyal to our public since the inception of our tenure. Let the public know everything because this will restrain every possible conflict.  Likewise, as far as possible, the other municipalities should focus on utilising their own resources including human resources. This will not only provide employment to the locals but also reduce the cost of the projects. Many things can be done in small amounts.  In education, we have been running various colleges, but if everything goes well and if we receive sufficient support from the government, we can also run the Khwopa University. If it doesn’t happen, we will add more colleges and new streams to it.  In the health sector, currently, we have a 25-bed Khwopa Hospital, and soon we will make it a 100-bed.  At present, around 700 patients get treatment here. Then, we are also establishing health centres in every ward that include a doctor.  Likewise, our expert team will continuously run health camps for cancer, dental and other patients. And, the door to door nursing service will be given continuity.  Yes, there are some ways we have thought for the betterment of our art and culture. We will  begin with schools . We will send the cultural experts to schools to teach the students about our art and culture. This can be an effective method to pass our art and culture to a new generation. Similarly, we will teach the students to play our traditional musical instruments. We will not limit our ideas in teaching, but we will create a platform where students can compete to showcase their talent related to art and culture.  With that, we will also provide financial aid to endangered art and culture for their preservation. Firstly, we will execute all the promises mentioned in our manifesto. There will be no issue with drinking water. Similarly, there will also be no problems related to sewage management. We have already started to work for a wastewater treatment plant.  In the upcoming five years, we will also fix the problem of unmanaged wires on electric poles. Those wires will be removed; the process for it has already started. We will also try to make as many traditional model houses as possible.     So on, we will also make our youth more skilled. Classes in various languages such as Chinese, Japanese and others will be provided to them. We want our young to know at least a couple of languages. To ensure the youth’s employment, we will conduct free training on mobile repairing, vehicle repairing, plumbing and more. In the previous term as well, we provided free training in carpentry, masonry, tailoring and others.   There will also be some changes in security and the transportation system. As soon as possible, we will form metropolitan police and install the CC cameras in all the places where it has not been installed. Regarding transportation, soon, we will stop vehicular movement in the core city area.  There are seven bridges being constructed on the south side of the municipality. The vehicles will use those bridges. Two of the bridges have already been completed.",political

Can Maoists win back the trust of the people in urban Nepal?,"During the armed conflict, the then CPN-Maoist used to say that over 80 per cent of Nepal’s rural area was under its control although their presence was negligible in urban Nepal. But, a few years later, the Maoists agreed to a peace treaty. They dropped their bullets and picked up ballot papers.  Since then, they have taken part in four elections. Apart from the 2008 elections, in which the Maoists did well, their performance in urban Nepal has been dire. And, this is a major problem for the party that wants to create a good image in Nepal’s major cities. The problem got manifested in  recent local elections  also. Himal Sharma, a central member of the CPN-Maoist Centre, says even though its presence in the cities is good, election results say otherwise.  “We want to change this. We’re always talking about how we can win the trust of the urban crowd,” says Sharma. In Kathmandu, the number of votes the party got has increased, but the results have not been positive. When the Maoists contested the elections in 2008, the story was different. The party did well in the rural areas, but their performance in urban Nepal was quite promising too. Out of Kathmandu’s 10 constituencies, they had won five of them. Jhakku Prasad Subedi, a nobody, even beat Madhav Kumar Nepal shocking everyone. But after that, things have not been good. During the 2013 elections, The party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself lost as no Maoist leader won in Kathmandu valley. In the 2017 local elections, the situation was similar as the Maoists could secure victory in only one municipality in the valley despite the party forming a coalition with the CPN-UML.  They did, however, win the posts of vice-chairman of Lalitpur’s  Bagmati  and  Mahankal  rural municipalities and deputy mayor of  Madhyapur Thimi municipality  this time. But even these were thanks to the coalition it formed with the Nepali Congress and the Unified Socialist. The Maoists that had won Laltipur’s  Konjyosom rural municipality  on its own in 2017 were not able to win this year even though they had a coalition. What was embarrassing was its inability to win the deputy mayor election in Lalitpur even though it got a lot of support from the Nepali Congress. The CPN-Maoist Centre also failed to win the deputy mayor election in Kathmandu’s  Tarakeshwar ,  Kageshwari Manohara  and  Gokarneshwar  municipalities. In  Tokha ,  Budhanilakantha ,  Shankarapur ,  Nagarjun  and  Kirtipur , they contested alone but was not able to win. Away from the valley, the party’s performance is similar as far as urban Nepal is concerned. The only city where it did well is  Bharatpur  where Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s daughter  Renu Dahal won the mayoral election . There are other municipalities it has won, but almost all of them are in the country’s rural areas. In  Biratnagar , it did not win a single ward as it got fewer votes than it did in 2017 despite the number of voters increasing. In  Dharan sub-metropolitan city , it did win the deputy mayoral election thanks to the coalition but could not win a single ward. Its number of votes also went down compared to last time. In  Butwal , it only won one ward. Thanks to the coalition, the Maoists won the mayor of  Jitpur-Simara  sub-metropolitan city but only won four wards compared to the 10 they won in 2017. They also lost in the  Ghorahi sub-metropolitan city . Political commentator Hari Roka says that the reason for the lack of support for the party in urban Nepal is that the Maoists forgot the poor people who live in the cities. “The city elite didn’t vote for them, the poor did. Why? Because the Maoists raised their concern, which led to an increment in wages and other facilities,” says Roka. He argues that since then the Maoists have not had a proper agenda for urban Nepal as he feels that the party has lost its core values. “What they want and aim to do isn’t clear anymore. They could’ve pushed for policies for smaller industries to make things easier for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). But, they did nothing and the low number of votes from urban Nepal is an example of this,” says Roka. He says even though the party had won the hearts of some people in urban Nepal, that was only temporary as the party could not maintain its positive image amongst the people in the cities for long. “It should have come up with a long-term plan, but a lack of vision and proper programmes meant it could not do as well as it had hoped for,” says Roka. Maoist leaders know this too. DP Dhakal, a central member of the party, agrees that they have not been able to fulfil their promises made to the people in urban Nepal, and hence they do not believe in them anymore. “We couldn’t take advantage of what we were able to do in 2008. Rather than putting our focus on this, we spent time quarrelling with each other and split. This was our biggest mistake,” he says. Maoist leader Himal Sharma says they will talk about the party’s poor performance in urban Nepal in the forthcoming central committee meeting. “We will review this and talk about how we can move forward in cities,” says Sharma. “We will take a new approach; that’s for sure.” Dhakal says that a revival is possible if the party does a few things. First, he says the party needs to do away with its initial political ideology. Second, he says the party needs to improve its management and focus on marketing so people know what it is doing. Lastly, he says it needs to focus on creating jobs and opportunities.  “People in urban Nepal will vote if they believe we can create change. Now, we need to work hard on it,” says Dhakal.

Balen Shah: The new Kathmandu mayor represents a change in every way,"Independent candidates  rarely win major elections in Nepal, but Balen Shah aka Balen or Balendra Shah has changed history.  Though political analysts had ruled out  his victory , and though his claim to get 90,835 votes was not achieved in numbers, he bagged his win as the mayor of  Kathmandu , Nepal’s capital. Now, he will become one of the youngest mayors of Nepal, at 32. But, this is not only about age. Balen Shah’s victory represents the idea of change in every way. Given his background, his win is the victory of change. Here is why. Balen Shah is one of the renowned figures in the Nepali music scene, especially in the  hip-hop  music community, and is best known for his freestyle  rap battle . He took his education and musical career simultaneously. He also has his own YouTube channel. Shah, in his songs, has always advocated for social issues for a long time. However, now, he wants to solve them for real after winning the position of the mayor. As a civil engineer professionally, he owns and leads Balen Consulting & Construction Pvt Ltd.  After the great 2015 earthquake, Balen Shah became active in rescue and relief work and also created the image of a social worker. Even before his nomination was filed, the youth residing in Kathmandu city poured their love for the young and upcoming leader.  His nomination  was heavily celebrated and the election results proved his popularity. Shah got votes not just from the outer city as expected but also from the core city.  The engineer-rapper-turned-leader is also frustrated with the elderly leaders who have been in the topmost position for a long time. The public has to go through a lot of hassles even to acquire simple documents from government offices. This time the shared frustration among the young voters and hence garnered a lot of votes and hopes from the city dwellers. His election campaign, hence, ran under the theme #BalenForMayor #AbaYuvaKoPalo [It is now youngers’ turns]”. Balen Shah says his objective is to create a healthy environment where the public is both mentally and physically well.  Balen Shah holds a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from the White House Institute of Technology and a master’s degree in structural engineering from the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Karnataka of India. Based on this, he says, it will be crucial for his successful tenure. He aspires to upgrade the infrastructure of Kathmandu if he becomes the mayor. For that, he claims that his educational background in structural engineering is an asset. His plans include building physical infrastructure as well as improving and accommodating Kathmandu roads for electric vehicles. As an engineer, he has already worked on different reconstruction projects in different parts of the country. Understanding Balen Shah’s outstanding performance shows us a larger picture of Nepali democracy’s evolution. He intends to start an infrastructure ambulance to keep the city’s infrastructure in good shape. In his  manifesto , he has promised to form a greater Nepa valley cosmopolitan that features a digital government and idea bank as well as an innovation centre for innovative ideas and creative entrepreneurs. Likewise, he says his focus will be on the development of education, sanitation and waste management along with the availability of water for all, preserving art and culture, increasing tourism and controlling pollution. He says that people with skills will get employment rather than those with a degree.",political
How will Balen Shah rule Kathmandu? A choice between a negotiating mayor and a confrontational one,"Now, it has become certain that Balen Shah is going to launch a victory and  become the mayor of Kathmandu . Soon, Shah will elevate himself from the streets to the hot seat in Bagdurbar; Balen Shah will be Mayor Balen Shah. Is this a story from obscurity to prominence? Whatever normative explanation the author omits, the positive fact remains: the possibility of Balen Shah becoming the mayor is becoming more formidable. Antecedent to this article, there were analyses on  whether Shah would win or not . Now, seeing the situation ripe enough, we shift our analysis to how Shah would rule. However, understanding Balen Shah’s model of urban governance will be tricky. Shah has not shielded away from making bombastic idealistic claims accounting only for his election manifesto. Only taking his election manifesto as a base would paint a rather rosy picture which would be more of Shah’s propaganda than an accurate analysis. Hence, what I will opt for is to curb his idealistic provisions with limitations existing in statute and politics. While it is a known fact that governing is a very tricky business: especially for those that wish to sweep the slug. Launching a campaign is just the start: the ironies, rhetoric, and prose create a powerful revolutionary zing. Shah’s campaign raised expectations. Seeing the results, the narratives, rhetoric, and prose played in his favour. Balen Shah promised substantive change. He might be willing to provide it, but is he capable of it? People do not realise that the delivery of substantive change should be under the correct procedure. There exist acts, rules, and regulations to follow. There are legal boundaries and jurisdictions to abide by corollaries of other restrictions. Can Shah deliver besides all this? However, for this analysis, let’s suppose Balen Shah will now have two major choices. The  constitution of Nepal  has made Nepal a federal democratic republic state. The country has vertical federalism with three tiers of governance: federal, provincial and local. In a three-tier governance system, there is severe jurisdiction over the roles and duties of municipal authority. Lyndon Johnson, an American politician famously, japed a joke that “Things could be worse. I could be a mayor.” Similar to Nepal, in America too, there is vertical federalism. Taking reference from America, it is likely that in Nepal too, the mayor will suffer from a problem. That is a severe restriction due to having authority only within a limited sphere. Mayors are little Caesar as they are colloquially called in America. The same fate lies with Nepali mayors too. The problem with Balen Shah is that the sizable authority he will wield will be considerably low. According to the Local Government Operation Act, 2017, the power is fundamentally in the hands of the metropolitan assembly. To pass any policy, Shah will need a majority in the assembly. But, he will be alone in the 162-member assembly hall. Fundamentally, two parties will be present: CPN-UML and Nepali Congress (NC). There are possibly two scenarios that will come up: either the NC will fall short of commanding the majority, or the NC will hold the majority. Both these cases would mean that Shah will have to stay in a negotiatory and mediatory capacity as the metropolitan mayor. But, how will Balen Shah deal with those he campaigned against? This will be the first test that Shah will face and we will understand his political maturity. Nothing suggests that Shah will have a favourable environment to govern. Midst of all the troubles, he is expected to deliver. Not only horizontal procedural curtailment, but Shah will also face the problem of vertical federalism. He will face a lot of anticipation from the general public. As a mere metropolitan mayor, he will not have the capacity to meet all of the public expectations. The reason for it will be vertical federalism’s curtailment. It is a general understanding that a mayor has limited functions in the play; he has limited roles or constrained roles dictated by the statute. How will Balen Shah cope with this; only time will tell! Most probably, Shah will take up a negotiatory stance with the parties. His mediatory and bargaining skills will decide his fate as a mayor. In Nepal, it is a known fact that a ward chairperson holds more power than a mayor. A mayor’s role is limited to something as a manager who manages the administration of the city. Looking at primia facie, the mayoral position seems more like that of a bureaucratic head. So, can a democratically elected position be only limited to mere administration? A debate was sparked in the western hemisphere: the debate between technocracy and democracy. Shah’s win can already spark this debate in our country too. In Nepal, mayoral positions have become more technocratic than democratic. Rather than taking active executive decisions and policy reform, the mayor seems like a department store manager. Policy-level intervention in such positions is rarely seen. Shah must understand that the Kathmandu voters elevated him to the position of a politician and not an administrator.  But, in a local government, the ideological divide rarely surfaces, which might be a good thing as everyone can have a consensus agenda of development. However, has there ever been such consensus ever? The individuals that reach the hot seat might be from the city, but their agenda is set by their parties. Now that a party-less Balen Shah will be elected to the post, should not he also hold the ideologies of his voters? Shah is democratically elected as a backdrop against the voter’s angst against national parties.  The very concept of a technocratic mayor goes against the voter’s mandate. If Shah wants to stand up to the blatant bullying of big parties, another way forward would be of a confrontational mayor than a negotiating mayor. The technocratic conception of the mayoral post is well established in the context of Nepal. However, this conception is nowadays challenged. Cities are taken to be only facing technical problems of petty administration. However, this view is not ubiquitous. For example, in February 2004, the San Francisco mayor argued that he was required by California and US constitutions to order the city of San Francisco to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. This highly political decision was taken, and later on, it was accepted by the US Supreme court. Likewise, Shah can also use his mayoral position to bring policy-level changes. The policy dynamics of the country will shift and could even land Balen Shah a powerful political trend behind him. Shah can empower and enhance federalism and change local government from being technocratic to democratic without challenging the constitution itself. His model of urban governance could be more political than ever imagined. While nowhere in his manifesto did these political ideologies or leanings can be found, the overall political zing before Shah suggests the voters of Kathmandu were not appointing a bureaucrat but electing a leader.",political
Poor poll performance forces Rabindra Mishra to resign as Bibeksheel Sajha Party chief,"Kathmandu, May 25 The  poor performance  in the recent local elections has forced Rabindra Mishra to resign as the chief of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. Mishra says  he has decided to resign taking all responsibility for the  party’s humiliating performance . He, however, says he will continue working in the party as a general member. Mishra has also requested the party’s central committee to withdraw  action taken against Milan Pandey  and other dissident leaders for objecting to his controversial document titled  Nation above Notion.  He argues the action could be withdrawn as the chairperson proposing the document has already resigned. Rabindra Mishra, in his statement, has claimed major political parties in the country have also adopted his agenda although the party could not fare well in the recent elections. “The country’s transformation would not be possible unless our agenda is addressed.” “The central work performance committee and the central committee will make a decision on how to move the party forward after a serious discussion and review,” he says, “I believe the leadership of my friends in the central committee will restore the party’s repute.

Chiri Babu Maharjan: 5 things to know about Lalitpur mayor reelected for the second term,"Chiri Babu Maharjan, 65, has been elected the mayor of  Lalitpur , one of the three metropolitan cities in the Bagmati province and one of the two in the Kathmandu valley, by defeating Hari Krishna Byanjankar. Nepali Congress’ Maharjan garnered 42,722 votes whereas UML’s Byanjankar was restricted to 24,560. Here are five essential things you need to know to know Chiri Babu Maharjan and his vision for Lalitpur. Her father Nhuchhelal died when Chiri Babu Maharjan was quite young. Hence, Maharjan continued his studies by working as a  daily wage worker . After the 6th grade, it became very difficult for him to continue his education. Indira Yakthumba, the founder of Gyanodaya Balbatika, decided to support his education up to class 10. After passing the secondary level with good marks in the mid-1970s, he started working and studying together.  He did ICom from the Public Youth Campus, BCom from Patan Campus and MCom from Tribhuvan University Kirtipur. His socio-political activism started when he was a class 10 student. Before becoming the mayor of Lalitpur in 2017, Chiri Babu Maharjan was elected ward chairman three times. Supporting the people’s movement of 1990, he resigned from the post of ward chairman of the Panchayat system and joined the Nepali Congress immediately. In the next local elections in 1992, he got elected the ward chair again. Chiri Babu Maharjan is the founding president of the Jyapu Society established in the early 2000s. That initiative also helped him become the mayor of Lalitpur in the last elections. He was ahead of CPN-UML’s Hari Krishna Byanjankar by 326 votes. In the last local elections in Lalitpur, the Congress had fought alone and the UML in coordination with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP). Ramesh Maharjan of the Bibeksheel Saja Party got 13,458 votes and Dinesh Maharjan of the Maoist party got 10,661 votes. The main competition for the mayoral post was between Chiri Babu Maharjan of the Nepali Congress and Hari Krishna Byanjankar of the CPN-UML. The same competition repeated this time, but Maharjan significantly widened the margin.  Chiri Babu Maharjan is already a tested and approved leader as his term as the mayor of Lalitpur is quite successful. He says, “I have done a lot of work in the Jyapu Society. That is why the votes of many Maharjans have come to me, which also made the victory easier. ‘ He further says, “In the last five years, we have built many projects for the welfare of the city dwellers. No one is new to the mayor to complete those projects in the project bank, I think I am the one who is qualified and capable to understand everything.” Maharjan claims he had completed  7,500 development projects in five years. Now re-elected, Chiri Babu Maharjan plans to dig deep tube wells even if there is no water facility in all places even after the arrival of  Melamchi water . He also plans to plant trees on the banks of the Bagmati. Maharjan says a feasibility study would be started immediately to build a 1.4 km long flyover from Thapathali to Pulchok. He plans to provide free pre-school education in every ward. “I have many priorities. Collectively, heritage conservation is a top priority. The second priority is environmental improvement. The third is to improve education and health and create jobs.”",political
Gopal Hamal: A trader-turned-social worker is now the mayor of Dhangadhi,"One after another,  independent candidates  are emerging victorious in the recently held local elections. Those independent candidates are creating a commotion in different major cities of the country such as Kathmandu,  Dharan , Dhangadhi and Janakapur. One among them is the 58-year-old Gopal Hamal of Dhangadhi, popularly known as ‘Gopi Dai’.  Popular in his hometown of  Dhangadhi , he got 26,865 votes, over 12,000 more than his nearest competitor Nripa Bahadur Wad of Nepali Congress. Here are five key details about Gopi Hamal and his vision for Dhangadhi that you should know. Gopal Hamal gained popularity among the locals of Dhangadhi through active involvement in social service and contribution to the  Chamber of Commerce and Industry . Likewise, he was also lauded for his project through which he wants to turn far-western Nepal into a popular tourist destination. Recently, he also started a free hearse service. He also started a clothes bank in Dhangadhi which gained him further popularity among the masses. Prior to running as an independent candidate for mayor of  Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city, Gopal Hamal was associated with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. He was even a party’s coordinator of the Sudurpaschim province. But, as he received suggestions from his trusted ones to run independently for the post of mayor rather than by being involved with political parties, he decided to resign from Bibeksheel Sajha Party and filed the nomination as an independent candidate. This is Gopal Hamal’s second time contesting the local elections for the post of mayor. During the 2017 local elections, he contested as an independent candidate losing by a mere 2,700 votes. It was after his loss during the 2017 elections that he joined the Bibeksheel Sajha party. Gopal Hamal has publicly pledged that he will not take any facilities from the government after being elected the mayor of the Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city.  He has even said that he will not use the vehicle provided by the city government.  “Once, I will become the mayor, I will not take a single penny from the government,” he said during his election campaign. Gopal Hamal has three main priorities. Firstly, he wants to build a mechanism against corruption. Zero tolerance against corruption is one of his key mottos. Secondly, the independent mayor wants to resolve the problem of flooding. And lastly, he wants to make Dhangadhi a well-managed city.",political
"Dhana Raj Acharya: The new mayor of Pokhara, Nepal’s tourism capital, is a man with many hats","Dhana Raj Acharya of the CPN-Unified Socialist has been elected the mayor of  Pokhara , the largest metropolitan city in terms of area, and apparently  Nepal’s tourism capital . The 52-year-old Acharya garnered 58,893 votes whereas Krishna Bahadur Thapa of CPN-UML was restricted to 52,848. Whereas it is Acharya’s first time in a public office, he is an established name in several other sectors. Here are five essential things you need to know to know Dhana Raj Acharya and his vision for Pokhara. Dhana Raj Acharya says he has a vision and a will to work. He is also a capable leader. Although he represents a new party that is yet to expand its organisation across Nepal, Acharya was able to garner a good number of votes in the toughly-fought mayoral election. People believe many of his voters were outside the Unified Socialist and the ruling alliance. Apparently, many cadres of the opposition UML voted for him thanks to his good impression.  Dhana Raj Acharya has been active in the Lions Club for more than a decade and has not been involved in any controversy till now. He was the governor of the club in 2017/2018. He hence had hoped he would win the votes of the Lions. Dhana Raj Acharya had played an important role in making Krishna Thapa of the UML the mayor in 1997. Hence, he had considered the competition to be very interesting this time.  Dhana Raj Acharya came to prominence in Pokhara politics in 1994 as a student leader at the Prithvi Narayan Campus, but he was not active in mainstream politics for a long time. Nonetheless, he was involved in the CPN-UML’s student wing and Kaski district committee for some years. After the  split of the CPN-UML last year , senior UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal formed a parallel committee across the country. Acharya returned to politics as the Kaski coordinator of the same committee. His return to politics had been a headache for Kaski UML. If you believe Dhana Raj Acharya is an irregular politician, you can surely say he is a regular business person. He has made a big economic leap in the meantime.  He started his business in a stationery store. While active in industry and business, Acharya did not give up the ropes of business associations close to the UML. In 2003, he became the head of UML’s Kaski Industry and Business Department. From 2004 to 2012, he was the fraction secretary of the Federation of Nepal Book and Stationery Entrepreneurs. Acharya was also active in the Federation of Nepalese National Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Entrepreneurs and took charge of the central industry and labour department of the CPN-UML.",political

Renu Dahal: The Maoist supremo’s daughter has firmly established her own career with the second win,"After winning the local elections, the 46-year-old Renu Dahal of the CPN-Maoist Centre is now beginning her second term as the mayor of the  Bharatpur metropolitan city .  Dahal won the elections with 52,030 votes defeating her opponent Bijay Subedi of CPN- UML who got 39,581 votes. Here are some pointers that you need to know to know her better. Renu Dahal is the second eldest daughter of party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Sita Dahal. Active in and during the  People’s War , she has been an active and popular political figure. Education-wise, she is just a secondary school graduate.  Other than being active in wartime, Renu Dahal was a member of the Constituent Assembly from 2008 to 2012. In the second CA elections (2013), she became the candidate in Kathmandu’s constituency 1 but lost to Prakash Man Singh of the Nepali Congress.  She has been a member of the party’s politburo and the general secretary of the All Nepal Women’s Association (Revolutionary). In 2017,  Renu Dahal won the mayorship with 43,127 votes  against Devi Prasad Gyawali of the UML, who got 42,924 votes. However, her victory was excessively controversial. Reportedly, some ballot papers were torn when the then Chief Election Officer Kabi Prasad Neupane went to the toilet while the votes were being counted. After that, the then UML mayoral candidate Gyawali claimed that the ballot papers were torn in a planned manner after the Maoists were sure to lose. There was a dispute in the counting of votes stating that the ink of the swastika on the ballot paper was smeared more and was to be null and void. But, the case reached the court through the Election Commission. After that, it was ordered that there would be re-election in ward 19 of the Bharatpur metropolis. Renu Dahal won the election by 203 votes. Notwithstanding the controversial beginning of the term, Renu Dahal’s mayorship is viewed as a success.  Widely portrayed as Dahal’s daughter, she says she has become a separate personality after becoming the mayor. As a woman mayor who completed her five-year term successfully, she sent a strong message that she can lead and is a strong political figure for development works. Though reelected, she once expressed that she did not want to run for the mayor again. For her, advancing politically either by being a member of parliament or a minister would not have been a big deal. But in Bharatpur, she felt working at the local level is challenging, and wanted to face the challenge. Reportedly, there have been fewer cases of irregularity or corruption in the metropolis, so she has created a situation where no one can question her leadership. The arrears of the metropolis is also less than the others.  This time, however, no substantial controversy was reported in Bharatpur as security arrangements were also tightened. On the other hand, she also multiplied the difference with her closest rival this time. This time also, Renu Dahal was supported by the Nepali Congress. However, a popular leader of the party in Bharatpur, Jagannath Paudel, had filed his candidacy independently. It was feared that Paudel’s candidacy could block Dahal from regaining mayorship. But, as the results came out, Dahal proved she deserved to be the mayor as Paudel was restricted to just 14,728 votes whereas Dahal received 52,030 votes.",political
Know Birgunj Mayor Rajesh Man Singh in 5 points,"Rajesh Man Singh has been elected the mayor of  Birgunj , the only metropolitan city in the Madhesh province, by defeating outgoing mayor Vijay Sarawagi. Singh garnered 46,215 voters whereas UML’s Sarawagi was restricted to 23,671. Here are five essential things you need to know to know Rajesh Man Singh and his vision for Birgunj. Rajesh Man Singh, 52, is a leader of the Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal (JSPN). However, until a few months before the election, he was a leader of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal, a  splinter group of the JSPN .  He is considered an outspoken speaker and believed to speak against wrongs. He has claimed on multiple occasions that if the people of Birgunj are subjected to injustice, he will stand by them. Not just this year, but in the local elections of 2017 too, Rajesh Man Singh competed with Bijay Sarawagi for the post of mayor in Birgunj. Where Sarawagi of the then Federal Socialist Forum won the election with 19,393 votes, Singh, who was in the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal, came third with 12,165 votes. Sarawagi and Singh were not just competitors, they also worked in the same party (JSPN) for almost a year. But, despite the party unity, the two groups did not get along very well. In 1986, Rajesh Man Singh became a member of the Nepal Students Union while studying IA. He then entered mainstream politics with Nepali Congress and was elected a ward member of Birgunj in the 1997 local elections.  In the early 2010s, he became the general secretary of Rastriya Janata Party Nepal.  As per his manifesto, Rajesh Man Singh’s goal is a prosperous Birgunj where people get the services easily, free of corruption and heavy taxes. He is committed to making the city systematic, working in the areas of sanitation, garbage management, mosquito control, education and health. Corruption is rampant in the metropolis and cases are ongoing in the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority ( CIAA ). If the pandemic had not occurred, there would have been loud protests led by Singh in the opposition, but outgoing Sarawagi turned lucky. So during his tenure, Singh is adamant to eradicate corruption, both individually and institutionally.",political
Nagesh Koirala: Biratnagar’s new mayor from the old family,"The new mayor of the  Biratnagar metropolitan city  is Nagesh Koirala from Nepali Congress. He represents the  grand Koirala family of Biratnagar  that has a significant contribution to Nepal’s democratic movement. The 48-year-old Koirala won the elections with 30,170 votes defeating his opponent Sagar Thapa of CPN-UML who got just 21,455 votes. However, he will be supported by deputy mayor Shilpa Karki of the UML, who won 25,680 votes.  This will be Nagesh Koirala’s first term as the mayor and he has some promises to fulfil. Here are some things to know about the new mayor. He started his political career in 1997 and worked as the secretary of Nepal Tarun Dal, Morang. In 1999, he became the president of Tarun Dal, Morang, and continued his tenure for 13 years. After that, he served as the Morang treasurer of the Nepali Congress for five years and another term as secretary. From the 14th general convention of the party, he then worked as the district deputy chairman. Koirala has been active in politics for quite some time. He wanted to contest the 2017 elections too, but Nepali Congress did not think he was the right candidate and instead chose Bhim Parajuli to contest the elections. This year, however, things were different as Koirala got a  ticket  thanks to Shekhar Koirala’s lobbying in the central committee.  Nagesh Koirala has a master’s degree in public administration from a Philippian university. Before that, he completed his bachelor’s degree from Delhi University. During this time in the Philippines, he also taught. But, when he came back, he started his political career, giving up teaching. But deep inside, he still wants to be a teacher someday, he says. Koirala grew up in Biratnagar. His father Umesh was not interested in politics but rather in agriculture. However, Nagesh Koirala got influenced by his grandfather Rishikesh (Haribabu). Nagesh is the third member of the Koirala family to head Biratnagar. In 1957, Keshav Koirala (Shekhar Koirala’s father) became the mayor and in 1992, Ashok Koirala became the mayor of Biratnagar. Now Nagesh, who got the ticket with Shekhar’s support, has become the mayor of Biratnagar. During his election campaign, Nagesh Koirala made some big promises. Now that he has become the mayor, people are looking forward to his  words  including free power consumption of up to 30 units, and telephone and electrical cable-free roads.  As the elected mayor, he now has plans to improve the impractical tax system. Also, he says he has zero-tolerance for corruption while his priority is drinking water supply and waste management in Biratnagar.",political
"5 reasons why new Dharan mayor, Harka Sampang Rai, stands out","On Sunday, the Dharan sub-metropolitan city in eastern Nepal got its new mayor. The 39-year-old Harka Sampang Rai won the mayoral post of Dharan by securing 20,829 votes. If you are the one who is curious to know more about the newly elected mayor of Dharan, you have come to the right place here.  Unlike many other mayors in different big cities of Nepal, Harka Sampang Rai contested the election as  an independent candidate . That is why he stands out. Besides, there are a few other interesting facts about Mayor Rai that we list below.    For the last decade, Harka Sampang Rai has been a social activist in Dharan. He had been to Malaysia for a couple of years as a migrant worker. He joined the auto-rickshaw business and agriculture after returning to Nepal. And, later, he involved himself in various campaigns. His journey as a campaigner began with the  Sardu Watershed  Protection Campaign.  Rai gained popularity among locals of Dharan during a campaign held for solving the problem of drinking water. Asian Development Bank initiated a project to solve the problem by digging a well in a nearby forest, and fetching water by pumping. Since the method could decrease the lifespan of the pump and also spend more electricity, the locals of Dharan objected to the project. Instead, they demanded the authority to fetch water from Koshi and Tamor rivers. Rai was in the vanguard of the movement.    Unlike most of the candidates, Harka Sampang Rai’s electioneering was lowkey. He was seen holding his election campaign alone. There were no supporters behind him. Looking at his election campaign, probably nobody would have expected the result he brought. It seemed like he would secure the votes in just double digits, but things took a u-turn.  In one of his viral videos over social media, he is seen alone miking his visions and appealing for the votes.  Likewise, in another viral video, he is visiting the market area and distributing pamphlets that include his plans and visions, alone.  This is Harka Sampang Rai’s second time being an independent candidate for the Dharan mayoral election. Earlier, in 2019, he contested independently in the by-election for the post held after the death of incumbent  Tara Subba . In that election, Rai secured only 422 votes to get the fifth position.  Lately, Harka Sampang Rai has been highly centred on resolving the drinking water issue of Dharan. The city has been through a scarcity of drinking water for a long time, and now he wants to change things. He wanted to compete in the election with a symbol of a water tap, but as it was already appointed to somebody else, he was compelled to be recognised with the symbol of a stick during the election.    Harka Sampang Rai, the newly elected mayor, is also a good  singer  and guitarist. After he achieved the mayoral feat, his videos where he is seen singing alongside playing the acoustic guitar is going viral on social media.  Those songs are composed and written by Rai himself.  This might be additionally good news for the musicians based in Dharan.",political

Nepal lawmakers want beauty pageants banned,"Kathmandu, May 23 Lawmakers in Nepal have demanded the government ban  beauty pageants in the country . The demand comes after a  young woman exposed she was raped  in the name of a beauty pageant around eight years ago. Speaking in a meeting of the Women and Social Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives on Monday, CPN-Maoist Centre lawmaker Amrita Thapa says the state would not lose anything even if such events were banned. “ In the past also , we had said the state should seriously think about such events,” she said, “If it does not benefit the state, we shall be able to stop them.” Meanwhile, lawmakers have demanded the  removal of the statute of limitation  for rape cases in Nepal.",political
Lawmakers urge the government to remove the statute of limitation for rape,"Kathmandu, May 22 Female lawmakers have called on the government to remove the statute of limitation for rape in Nepal. A meeting of female lawmakers held in the House of Representatives on Sunday called on the government to remove such a provision, especially in the case of minors. This comes after a  girl last week released a series of videos  saying she was drugged, raped and blackmailed by an organiser of a beauty pageant when she was 16 in 2014. CPN-UML’s Binda Pandey during the meeting asked the government to take the case seriously and take action against the perpetrators. She also called on the government to amend the law. “If you want a statute of limitation, fine; but maybe it was time we revised it to the date the incident was made public by the survivor,” said Pandey during the meeting.  She showed anger at how the government did not take these incidents seriously even when women were being subject to rape and harassment time and again. “How can we have such a statute of limitation for young women. It doesn’t make sense so we need to change the law and remove this,” Pandey said calling on her fellow lawmakers to push the government to amend the law as soon as possible. Similarly, Nepali Congress lawmaker Pushpa Bhusal called on the government to give justice to the woman as soon as possible. Maoist Centre’s Amrita Thapa Magar said the government should offer relief to the young woman who had to undergo such a heinous act at such a young age. She also stated that since incidents like these were seen as a common affair in  Nepal’s entertainment scene , it was time something was done about it. “This will only end if everyone works together,” Thapa Magar said.",political

This is how Madhesh-based parties are losing control over their stronghold,"Nepal’s Madhesh-based parties are trying to create a space for themselves on the national political scene. They are trying everything, from merging with parties run by Khas-Aryan politicians to expanding the party dynamics. But, despite this, the performance of these parties in their home, the Madhesh province, during the  local elections  has been dire, to say the least. There are two major parties in the Madhesh region: Janata Samajbadi Party (JSPN) and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSPN). Compared to the 2017 elections, both Madhesh-based parties are doing very poorly. If you look at the data, these parties as of Sunday have got little over half the votes that they received during the 2017 elections. In 2017, the then Federalist Socialist Forum-Nepal won 26 units out of the 136 units in the province. Similarly, Rastriya Janata Party (RJP) won 25 units.  This time, the picture is different. The JSPN has only won 27 local units so far and leads in 6. The LSPN’s state is even dire as so far, it has only won in 11 areas and leads in 4. The JSPN has done well in areas it did not win. But, oddly it has not been able to win areas that it did win during the 2017 elections. It has been able to win Bara’s Kariyamai, Sarlahi’s Basbariya, Siraha’s Nawarajpur, Dhanusha’s Janaknandini and Mahotari’s Pipara which were won by Nepali Congress in 2017. It has also won in areas won by the Maoist Centre like Dhanusha’s Shahidnagar and Siraha’s Arnama. But, the party has also lost areas it won in 2017 like Saptari’s Bodebarsain, Mahadewa, and Rajbiraj among others. The same is the case in Saptari’s Bariyarpatti, Bhagwanpur, and Laxmipur Patari. It has also failed to win in Mahotari’s Sonma, Sarlahi’s Kawilasi and Parsa’s Garuda. The LSPN’s state is similar. It has won in areas it did not win. It won in Saptari’s Mahadeva rural municipality which was won by the Maoist Centre. But in doing so, it also lost areas like Saptari’s Dakneswari, Rupani and HanumanNnagar; Dhanusha’s Janakpur and Hansapur, and Rautahat’s Gaur and Gajura among others. Apart from the LSPN and JSPN, other Madhesh-based parties have not done well either. CK Raut’s Janamat Party which is contesting the local elections for the first time has only won two units. Prior to the elections, there was a certain enthusiasm amongst people within the party who felt the Madhesh-based parties do well during the elections. But, those expectations have been shattered by the general public.  Terai Madhes Democratic Party, which split from the LSPN, also did nothing significant as its only won one unit. A few leaders from these Madhesh-based parties do not like that people think their party is limited to Madhesh. They want to stake their claim as a national party despite having a low number of members in the House of Representatives. They feel they are as strong as the CPN-UML or the Nepali Congress, but when it comes to the elections, their focus is limited to Madhesh. And, this is not wrong. After all, the Madhesh-based parties were established on the back of the Madhesh movement. But, if these parties want to stake their claim as a national party, they need to do thinking differently, say political analysts. And, losing units in the 2022 local elections is proof that people just do not believe in their vision anymore. The JSPN’s senior leader Ashok Rai agrees the party’s core area is still Madhesh. But, he does say they want to extend this and become a national party in the coming future. “We first focused on indigenous people and Madheshis because this is our identity. It’s easy for us to win here,” says Rai. The JSPN, being one of the biggest Madhesh-based parties, feels it is indispensable in Madhesh. But, that has not been the case as people seem to have stopped believing in them in recent times. This lack of belief among the people has upset many local leaders within the party. A few leaders from the JSPN threatened to quit the party as they felt it was not paying attention to the Lumbini province.  “We worked hard to establish the party in Lumbini, but people only want to focus on the Madhesh Pradesh. Why should we wear slippers and keep paying rent for the party office here,” says Kamaruddin Rai, JSPN’s Bake district chief. Rai and a few others nearly gave their names as independent candidates to contest in the local elections. Mohammad Istiyak Rai, a central member of the JSPN and a former minister was tired of trying to solve this issue. “I can’t go against what the local representatives of the party wanted to do,” he had said. The Madhesh-based parties’ members in the Lumbini province were angry that the leaders were asking them to forgo the elections as they wanted to contest the election with the Nepali Congress-led coalition. Their anger was justified as these local leaders did not want a coalition in four units including the  Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city . They did say that they would be open to a coalition in four other units in the province. But, the party, wanting to win big in the Madhesh province, did not listen to them and gave up the Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city. Even though angry, the leaders of Banke decided to be content with contesting for the post of deputy mayor of Nepalgunj. The reason why the JPSN had to give up on Nepalgunj was Biratnagar, where the party chairman Upendra Yadav’s son, Amrendra Yadav, contested for the deputy mayor. But, Amrendra Yadav has performed poorly as he trails behind UML’s Shilpa Karki by nearly 10,000 votes. On the contrary, Kamaruddin Rai has already become the deputy mayor of Nepalgunj. This shows that the Madhesh-based parties are popular away from the Madhesh province too, but the parties are yet to believe this. Leaders in the Banke district believe that senior leaders of the JSPN do not think beyond the Madhesh province and that in the long run will be its downfall. The LSPN, another of the biggest Madhesh-based parties, is the same. It does not see a future outside the Madhesh province. The party was formed after splitting from JSPN after KP Sharma Oli dissolved the House of Representatives. Following that, Upendra Yadav from the JSPN and Mahantha Thakur from the LSPN played a tug of war to include Resham Chaudhary.  But, Chaudary did not join either of the Madhesh-based parties as he did not believe in their vision and  formed his own party , which is doing quite well in Kailali.

Do 2022 local elections mark the death of alternative forces in Nepal?,"Before the recent local elections, no one had given  Balen Shah  a chance. His competitors had joked about him while people affiliated with the parties had said he was no threat. But, seven days after the elections, he shut the mouths of all naysayers as he leads the race to become the mayor of Kathmandu by over 10,000 votes. This has rocked Nepal’s two major political parties–the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress–as Shah almost has more votes than Keshav Sthapit and Sirjana Singh combined. As of Friday morning, this is not a close contest as Balen Shah aims to become the first independent candidate to become the mayor of  Kathmandu . This comes as a slap on the face of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party, a political party that claimed to be an alternative force in Nepal’s political scene. Its candidate Samikshya Baskota has performed incredibly poorly as she has only received 186 votes so far. This comes as a shock to everyone because, in the 2017 local elections, Bibeksheel Nepali and Sajha Party separately did quite well and gave Nepali Congress and UML a run for their money. That encouraged the emerging alternative forces to  merge the party  and move forward. But, their performance in the current local elections is pathetic, to say the least. We are not talking about Kathmandu only. Bibeksheel Sajha, as an alternative force, has done badly everywhere. So far, it has won the local leadership in a rural municipality in Bara only.  Another slap in its face comes from Gopal Hamal who left Bibeksheel Sajha and contested for the position of mayor in the  Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city . He has taken a major lead in the race, leaving behind candidates from the UML and Nepali Congress. Another independent, Harka Raj Rai, is leading the race in  Dharan sub-metropolitan city  too. Bibeksheel Sajha agrees that the  elections did not go as planned . Issuing a statement a few days after the polls, it stated it did not have the people who would give ample time to the party and also did not have the financial means to contest the election. “We have been able to establish ourselves in different parts of the country in these five years, but because we didn’t have human and financial resources, we didn’t do well in the election,” says a statement issued by the party’s spokesperson Sharad Raj Pathak. Pathak in the statement also wrote the party also felt the people did not like how unstable the party was as it  went through a lot in the five years . “We want to apologise to people who trusted us. We weren’t able to step up to people’s expectations,” the statement read. Political analyst Shyam Shrestha says Bibeksheel Sajha ‘s main reason for a poor showing was how it did everything major parties like Nepali Congress or the UML did. “There is nothing new when it comes to Bibeksheel Sajha. Its thinking is the same, its campaigning is the same and its action is also the same,” says Shrestha. Shrestha says the ideological inclination of the “alternative force” also was not any different. “When they  took the side of the monarchy , things got worse. People will never believe you when you don’t stick to one ideology,” Shrestha adds. Keshav Dahal, a former member of Bibeksheel Sajha, who was kicked out of the party, also says the public did not support it because of its political ideology. “We did change the political system, but our mannerism remained the same. The people wanted to change how politics was done in the country, but we spent most of our time in useless discourses,” says Dahal. “We started to discuss if the people wanted democracy, or if the country needed federalism and if being secular was right or wrong. These weren’t important issues. But, because our leaders gave emphasis to this, people didn’t like us.” He adds that the people of the country have some expectations from the alternative forces, but the party failed to live up to them. “People hate parties like UML, Maoists and Nepali Congress because they have ruined the notion of democracy and always promoted old leaderships. They also hated these parties were full of corrupt politicians. They wanted alternative parties to break this, but Naya Shakti and Bibeksheel couldn’t do better,” says Dahal. The one thing that irritated people was a document published by Rabindra Mishra, called Nation above Notion. In the document, Mishra has stated that the country needed to  rethink if it wanted to be a federal and a secular state . He even spoke to Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s chairman Rajendra Lingden about a possible merger. Both did not go down well with their supporters. But, the party disagrees this played a part. This has started a debate about if this is the death of alternative forces in the country. But, both Dahal and Shrestha argue this is just an anomaly and that there is a time for alternative forces to make a comeback in Nepali politics. “Look at how well independent candidates are doing in parts of the country this is a positive sign,” says Dahal. “The entry of young people into politics is also another good sign as people are getting interested. This shows that there is a space of alternative forces in Nepali politics.” Shrestha says the votes Balen Shah is getting in Kathmandu is promising. This, he says, shows that people want change. “The people who want change voted for Balen Shah,” says Shrestha. “They hope he can bring change.” But, he says people like Shah only focus on the middle class and the next alternative force should focus on the poor. “There is no one who does politics for the poor which make up 70 per cent of the population. If people can successfully push their vision on these people, a real alternative force can be born,” adds Shrestha.

Understanding Balen Shah’s likely victory as Kathmandu mayor in 5 points,"The recent local elections were full of surprises, especially the waves of individual  independent candidates  leading the polls in various municipalities. Among many, the major hotspot of this movement lies with Balen Shah (also referred to as Balendra Shah or Balen only), a notable singer of a particular music genre called rap.  Balen Shah is also a structural engineer and prides himself on his background. Initially,  his candidacy for the Kathmandu mayorship  was marked as something of a “joke,” and people have called  his winning lead “a fluke.”  However, while many have opted for a polarised view on the topic, Kathmandu voters have turned fanatic; the Nepali highbrows do not know what to make of it.  Is this an individual triumph, or is this a political trend? Various questions arise: Is this an attack on the system or the political direction? Is this a shift in the voting pattern? Has ethnic bloc voting and chain voting been a thing of the past? And, what does this result reveal about the future? Let’s discuss everything in turn.  Historically,  ethnic voting  was something that candidates had always needed to be mindful of. Even in India, candidates try wooing the ethnic votes and this trend is well established in the Terai region of Nepal also.  UML’s Kathmandu mayoral candidate  Keshav Sthapit  consistently asked people to trust him with his grip on the core cities. These core cities are where the ethnic bloc voters are- or were assumed to be. This time around, the core cities are giving Sthapit a disappointment; he is not getting the expected ethnic bloc votes.  Has ethnic bloc voting become an event of the past? Balen Shah’s powerful performance in the core city of the metropolis suggests ethnic bloc voting is slowly dissipating. When Balen Shah launched his campaigning, intellectuals turned sceptical about him because of his non-Newa background. There has been an open rule for parties to bring Newa individuals into the mayoral race to attract the “Newa votes.” Balen Shah has challenged this assumption and brought a truly powerful change. The end of bloc voting would mean a lot of stuff and would change the political dynamics. The major parties have a bastion in the valley because their party structure relies on this demography.  What happens when this demography is not reliable anymore? Time will tell how parties will react to this. However, one thing is for sure: the status quo of the valley is destroyed. The traditional election campaigning is now challenged. Elections in Nepal were about loudspeakers with flags and swarms of people or motorcycles crowding the streets. With incessant chants and rants, that was the election of the past. Moreover, the election was immensely costly and required physical presence.  But, now, traditional elections have become an event of the past. Balen Shah’s campaigning was digital, and the comments he got were: “He isn’t running for the mayor of Kathmandu, but the mayor of social media.” There remained a sceptical idea about whether this internet hype would be converted into electoral strength. Now, there remains no doubt: it really transformed into electoral strength.  The first instance where the internet made a majority of campaigning for a candidate. Balen Shah’s campaigning was mostly internet-based, and now when he is leading the elections, he has shown precedence. Balen Shah is a charismatic man, dressed in a three-piece suit with his goggles. He does not seem like your “aam admi”, a common man. While his background as a structural engineer sounds comforting, his charisma had little to do with his supposed victory.  In an interview, Balen Shah was asked a question: why he had contested this year’s election and not the years before. He gave a simple answer, “The number of  young people who can vote  this year around will lead me to a win.” He told his supporters as well as media personnel that he would secure 90,835 votes, around 25,000 more than what Bidya Sundar Shakya got five years ago.  However, what shall we call this election: a triumph of Balen Shah or a start of a movement? Many have called this eventful election a start of a tendency; they employ the case of Dhangadhi and Janakpur, where independent candidates are leading the polls. While it is true that these are independent candidates, their background is nothing like that of Balen Shah’s. Manoj Kumar Shah, who is leading the polls in Janakpur, is not a political outsider; he was a part of the ruling Nepali Congress party, and his candidacy was a reaction to the coalition’s joint candidacy. In other cities too, independent candidates are a part of politics, and their candidacy reacts to their dissatisfaction or ambitions.  However, Balen Shah’s speciality is he is totally a political outsider and has still managed to pull high in the election. While it is true that independent candidates are doing good this time around, there seems nothing different in overall election results: the Nepali Congress being first, the UML second, the Maoists third.  Independents are doing good, not because of a movement in Nepali politics but in voting trends. Hence, calling this a ‘movement’ would be foolish: there is no collective push and realisation. Balen Shah’s win is Balen Shah’s win.  Even if individuals have the right to file independent candidacy, we must not forget that Nepal is still a multiparty democracy. Independent candidates are a response to the Nepali voters’ eternal desire for alternative politics. However, parties vying for alternative politics like the Bibeksheel Sajha Party have not fared well in this election; in fact, they’ve fared much worse.  Is this phenomenon a challenge to the current system of Nepali governance of multiparty democracy? Have voters felt that the traditional parties and party-based governance system have become dysfunctional? The breaking down of the Nepal Communist Party, the intra-party rivalry between the Nepali Congress members, and the split and internal dynamics of the Bibeksheel Sajha Party might have made voters lose faith in the traditional parties. Moreover, the system might have been viewed as the problem itself.  However, the situation is very premature to draw any conclusions currently, but time will say what was the voters’ implicit message. Parties are growing weak, and is this good for a system of multiparty democracy? This is another question that Balen Shah’s win has posed to us. In conclusion, it really does not matter if Balen Shah wins or not. He has already been successful in giving a message: a message heard wide and clear through all of the countries. From the little huts of Suklaphanta to the hilly mudhouse of hills, the mountains dwellers, to the federal parliament itself- the message was received loud and clear. And, the message is simple: we had enough, and we are not planning on continuing.  Will this change the political dynamics of the country? We cannot say. However, one thing we can say: the traditional democracy is slowly evolving, and we are slowly getting a democratic conscience. This election was filled with surprises. Understanding Balenen Shah’s outstanding performance shows us a larger picture of Nepali democracy’s evolution. And, in the future, a voter with an enhanced democratic conscience will strengthen our democracy.",political

"Local elections offered a face-saver to the UML to end the 9-month House obstruction. Now, all parties need to learn a lesson","The main opposition, CPN-UML, on Tuesday  ended the nine-month-long House obstruction . Speaking in the first meeting of the new session of the House of Representatives, the party leader Pradeep Kumar Gyawali said the party decided to lift the obstruction due to two main reasons: the changed political context and the need to discuss crucial national issues such as the imminent economic crisis.  Whereas Gyawali did not discuss the first reason, political analysts believe this indeed was the major factor that forced the party to lift the House obstruction. Whereas the party’s continuous obstruction did not have any impact on the business of the House with the legislative body making crucial decisions such as  endorsing the controversial MCC grant deal , the UML might have already realised that its efforts are going in vain and nobody is going to paying heed. In fact, it was just searching for a face-saver to lift the obstruction. And, the party got this opportunity in the recent local election results. Although all the results have not become published, it is already clear that the UML is going to lose the status of the biggest party at the local level. While the decision to lift the obstruction is good, a more important question is if the UML and other parties learnt any lesson from its role in the record long House obstruction in Nepal’s parliamentary history, according to observers. The UML had been obstructing the parliament, accusing the speaker of discriminating against the party as he did not remove 14 lawmakers the party had taken action against, in August 2021. The lawmakers led by Madhav Kumar Nepal later  formed the new CPN-Unified Socialist , but the UML had been claiming the party was illegal.  Gyawali, in his address, did not discuss what the party gained and lost from the House obstruction. He did not bother to find out if the obstruction made any good to the party, the parliament and the country. But, Som Bahadur Thapa, a former official of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, says the ‘record feat’ could turn costly for the party. Yet, he hopes, it is good if the party learns any lesson from it and accepts its act was wrong. “If that is the case, we have to thank the party.” Thapa believes the relatively poor performance of the party in the recent local elections might also be a result of the wrong act of House obstruction. “To win the elections and get power, the votes from the cadres are not enough. You also need votes from neutral voters,” Thapa says, “Maybe, the UML lost votes from such neutral voters due to the House obstruction.” He believes such neutral voters were detached from the UML as the party continued House obstruction during the  third wave of the Covid pandemic  although it could have played a constructive role in helping the government deal with the crisis.  Therefore, calculating the potential risk the continuous obstruction might result in ahead of the parliamentary elections expected to be held in December this year, the party decided to end this, surmises Thapa. Veteran political analyst Lok Raj Baraj says the recent local elections offered the UML the right opportunity to learn a lesson. “Although you cannot be certain that it ended the House obstruction just because of the election results,” Baral says, “It appears the party has learnt a lesson about the possible impact of obstructing the House on election results.” From September 8, 2021, until the last House session got prorogued on March 15, 2022, the UML obstructed each meeting of the House of Representatives, protesting the role of the speaker in splitting the party. But, nine months on, it did not make any impact. “The party broke all records of House obstruction in Nepal,” political analyst Bishnu Dahal says, “But, it was not successful. Hence, it ended the obstruction without any condition.” Before this obstruction, the longest House obstruction in Nepal’s parliamentary history was of 58 days (around two months), this too from the UML’s side.  Repeating this, the party appeared irresponsible to the legislative system this time also, says Baral. “Its behaviours questioned the entire parliamentary system,” he says, “But, let’s not talk about the past for the party has realised it was wrong.”  “Now, the party got an excuse from the elections and also learnt a lesson from it.” Baral believes this incident shall teach the same lesson to all politicians.  The UML has also filed a case against the speaker and the newly formed CPN-Unified Socialist at the  Supreme Court . Whereas there is a law that no one can raise questions about anything sub-judice at the court in parliament, the UML vehemently disrespected it.  “But, this proved detrimental to the party itself,” Baral says, “Don’t you think other political parties have to learn a lesson from this?” Another political analyst Bishnu Dahal agrees.

UML discontinues parliament obstruction after 9 months,"Kathmandu, May 17 The main opposition, CPN-UML, has finally decided to discontinue the parliament obstruction from Tuesday after around nine months. The UML had been obstructing the parliament, accusing the speaker of discriminating against the party as he did not remove 14 lawmakers the party had taken action against, in August 2021. The lawmakers led by Madhav Kumar Nepal later  formed the new CPN-Unified Socialist , but the UML had been claiming the party was illegal. The UML has also filed a case against the party at the  Supreme Court . Even during the obstruction, the House spent the entire session and did some important jobs such as the  endorsement of the controversial MCC deal .  But, as soon as the House of Representatives meeting  began its new session  today, its leader Pradeep Gyawali addressed the meeting to inform the party would change the form of the protest as it would obstruct discussions about various topics. He also said the party made the decision as the people have already punished the leaders who supported the split, referring to the poor performance of the CPN-Unified Socialist in recent elections.  It has been learned that the party made the decision to lift the obstruction as the new breakaway faction has already been fully recognised with it participating in the recent local elections and winning some positions too.",political

Local elections expose major political leaders losing grip on their own areas,"The  preliminary results of the local elections  have shown how the influence of major political leaders like KP Sharma Oli, Sher Bahadur Dueba, Subas Chandra Nembang, and Bishnu Paudel is weakening in their own municipalities. The candidates who were considered close to them are not doing that well in the local election results. Some are trailing massively while some have already lost leaving both the candidates and the top leaders of the country with eggs on their faces. Take Chandra Bahadur Deuba for example. A close aide of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, Chandra Bahadur lost to Naresh Bhandari of Nepali Congress-BP by 129 votes in Dadeldhura’s  Ganyapadhura rural municipality  ward number 1. This is PM Deuba’s hometown.  Bhandari, who wanted to contest the local election, joined Nepali Congress-BP after Nepali Congress did not give him a ticket. Bhandari won with 673 votes, shocking everyone. But, in other areas of Dadeldhura, Nepali Congress did do well. In Ilam’s  Ilam municipality -1, the home of UML’s vice-chair Subas Nembang, a UML candidate Ambika Gautam lost to a Nepali Congress candidate Gayatri Ram Basnet by 51 votes. The UML is losing in the mayoral race of the local elections too. Its candidate Dhiren Kumar Chemjong is currently losing to Kedar Thapa of Nepali Congress by almost 1,000 votes. The UML is also likely to lose the deputy mayor seat to the Nepali congress there as Bishnu Kumari Limbu is leading UML’s Sita Devi Rijal by over 1,000 votes. Last local elections, things were different as the UML defected to Nepali Congress for both the mayor and deputy mayor posts. The UML is having a horror local election and that can be seen by how it is performing in its stronghold areas. In its chairman KP Sharma Oli’s hometown of  Damak , the UML’s mayoral candidate Gita Adhikari is lagging behind Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Ram Thapa. It is unlikely that the tally will change.  In  Butwal sub-metropolitan city , the home of Bishnu Paudel, UML’s vice-chair, UML is not doing great. Nepali Congress’ Khel Raj Pandey is leading the mayoral race by over 3,000 votes. The UML is not doing any good when it comes to local units too as it is trailing in many areas.  Things got bad to worse for UML leaders when Laxmi Pati Paudel, the husband of former Minister for Land and Management Padma Kumari Aryal, did not even win a ward membership in Syangja’s Waling municipality-1. Nepali Congress candidate Sambhav Aryal beat Paudel by 467 votes.   The UML is also struggling to win in the municipality of Gokul Baskota, a former minister and a member of UML’s politburo. The CPN-Unified Socialist, a group that split from the UML, is leading with a large difference in Kavrepalanchok’s  Mandendeupur municipality .  Tok Bahadur Tamang of Unified Socialist is leading UML’s Bidur Prasad Sapkota. But, the difference is narrow. The UML did win ward number 1 in Mandendeupur municipality, but it was a very close call. Shiva Prasad  Dhakal of the UML beat Nepali Congress’ Buddhiman Tamang by just four votes. But, in ward 2, the party’s Narayan Shahi lost to Nepali Congress’ Raj Kumar Malla.  Almost all the municipalities of top leaders are going through similar situations during the local elections this time. The candidate of Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, in Gorkha’s  Palungtar , the home municipality of the former prime minister Baburam Bhattarai, is in the second position.  The Maoist candidate Biwash Chintan is leading in Palungtar municipality. Prem Bahadur Gurung of the JSPN and  Dipak Babu Kandel of Nepali Congress are following Chintan with few vote differences. Likewise,  Biratnagar metropolitan city  of Morang is a place where JSPN Chairman Upendra Yadav is registered on a voter list. His son Amrendra Yadav is vying for the post of deputy mayor, representing the five-party coalition. But, his opponent Shilpa Karki of the UML is leading with more than double the number of votes. The home municipality of Mahantha Thakur, the major leader of Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal, is also in the same situation. The Maoist leader is leading at  Balara municipality  of Sarlahi while Thakur’s party Loktantrik Samajbadi Party has just stood as a competitor.  Rama Shankar Prasad Kushawale of the Maoist Centre is leading here while Abhaya Kumar Singh of LSPN  is in the second position and Kaushal Kumar Singh of the Nepali Congress is behind him with few vote differences.  For the deputy mayor as well, the candidate of the CPN Maoist, Koshila Devi is leading. Ragini Devi of the LSPN is behind her in the local election vote count.   This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Balen Shah for Kathmandu mayor: Is it too early to be certain?,"Who will be the next  Kathmandu mayor ? This is a question that is in everyone’s mouth. Will it be independent candidate  Balen Shah  or will it be UML’s  Keshav Sthapit  or Nepali Congress’ Sirjana Singh? With the  vote count going on at a snail’s pace , it is likely to take over a week to find out who will be Kathmandu’s mayor. There are 32 wards in Kathmandu and so far, officials have only counted all votes of wards 1 and 2 only. Likewise, the count of votes from wards 3, 4, 5, 31 and 32 has also begun. According to the vote count in these wards, Balen Shah has taken a healthy lead everywhere. As of Monday afternoon, he leads by 3,324 votes. But, this is just a start as around 90 per cent of Kathmandu’s votes are yet to be counted. A total of 191,186 people voted in Kathmandu. Cadres from both UML and the Nepali Congress-led coalitions say the tables will turn once they start counting votes from the core city where there are 43,067 votes in 12 wards. For whom these people vote will determine the winner and loser of the ongoing mayoral race.  Balen Shah during many interviews had said that he would be getting a lot of votes from outer Kathmandu. But, he did hope that people from the core city would also vote for him. While Shah hopes that people from the core city will vote for him, his hope has always been to get as many votes as he can from the outer city. As of now, he has got double the vote than Sthapit. His lead over Singh is more than double. There is a feeling among people from Balen Shah’s camp that the lead will increase further. But, the UML and coalition camp believe their candidates will do better in the long run than Shah. The wards whose votes are being counted are believed to be UML’s stronghold. But, Balen Shah has taken a strong lead in the area which has been a cause for concern for the UML. It is quite evident from the votes that the majority of people want youth to lead their city as Shah and  UML deputy mayor candidate   Sunita Dangol  both have a healthy lead over their competitors. But, UML and Sthapit are not losing sleep. The party believes it will make a comeback as most of its voters are from wards 16 and 31. Along with that, it also projects it will get a lot of votes from wards 5, 6, 7, 13, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 27. But, the UML knows it will face competition in wards 8, 12, 14, 23, 25, and 30. The Nepali Congress-led coalition also claims its votes will increase in as more wards are counted. Cadres from the party say they will challenge the UML in wards 5, 6, 7, 13, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 27. The Nepali Congress-led coalition believes Sirjana Singh will pip Keshav Sthapit and Balen Shah to become Kathmandu’s mayor. According to some Nepali Congress leaders, they will get a lot of votes from wards 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 23, and 26. Ward 16 is key in all this as it has the most voters in Kathmandu at 20,175, out of which 12,336 voted. Another key area is ward 32, where 12,015 voted. According to the preliminary reports, Balen Shah is likely to get more votes than any of the political parties in ward 32, where the count has already started. But, the determining factor on who wins will all depend on what the core city does. Both Sthapit and Singh are from the Newa community and are counting on their votes to win the election. But, with the two cutting each other votes along with another independent candidate Suman Sayami, it will be interesting to see what happens.  Balen Shah, who has become a beacon of hope for the youth, will hope that people from the core city would have voted for him too.

Poor performance in Kathmandu: Bibeksheel Sajha says people didn’t like recent developments in the party,"Kathmandu, May 16 After a humiliating performance in the  Kathmandu metropolitan city  in the  recent local elections , the Rabindra Mishra-led Bibeksheel Sajha Party says it accepts people did not like recent developments in the party. In the 2017 local elections, the then Bibeksheel and Sajha parties jointly had secured over 45,000 votes. Accordingly, the unified party’s mayoral candidate Samiksha Baskota was expected to receive a significant amount of votes this time. While the vote count is underway, Baskota has not crossed even 100 votes whereas the leading candidate, Balen Shah, is already over the 6,000 mark. In this context, the party’s spokesperson Sharad Raj Pathak issued the statement on Monday morning and accepted that the party’s internal conflicts are responsible for the humiliating performance. Following the  endorsement of Rabindra Mishra’s document –the Nation above Notion– that advocates for the referendum on secularism and discontinuity of federalism, the party has split again with influential leaders such as  Milan Pandey and Ranju Darshana leaving this . In the statement, Pathak claims the document itself is not responsible for the loss but for other disputes in the party.

"As Balen Shah’s lead continues to excite Kathmandu, the slow vote count across Nepal frustrates the nation","Kathmandu, May 15 Nepal is counting votes from the  local elections held  last Friday. While people are excited about emerging developments, the most surprising news for them has been independent candidate  Balen Shah ‘s lead in the  Kathmandu metropolitan city . As of 11:15 am on Sunday, the rapper has received 2,457 against CPN-UML’s Keshav Sthapit (1,427) and Sirjana Singh of the Nepali Congress (1,168). Whereas Balen Shah’s supporters are already hopeful of his victory, the UML and Congress party people think this might not be the case as a lot of votes are yet to be counted. Both might be right because the pace of vote count is frustratingly slow. According to reports, at least 150,000 votes have been cast in Kathmandu city, but so far less than 7,000 votes have been counted. All local units in the country share this pace. Most units began the count on Saturday morning, but only around 20 local governments have completed the count. Nepal has 753 local governments, but the election process has been halted in a few of them due to sporadic violence cases on the voting day and deaths of candidates before that.  In five of the six metropolitan cities except for Kathmandu, where independent Balen Shah is leading, the ruling alliance is leading the count for mayoral positions.",political
Lalitpur: More votes for nonexistent Nepali Congress deputy mayor candidate than for the one it supports,"Kathmandu, May 15 While vote count is underway in most of the local units across the country, the  Lalitpur metropolitan city  has seen an odd development. In the city, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-Maoist Centre had partnered, according to which the Nepali Congress fielded Chiri Babu Maharjan for the mayor and the Maoist Centre field Babu Raj Bajracharya as his deputy.  While Maharjan is leading the count probably with the Maoist Centre’s support in Lalitpur, the deputy mayoral candidate Bajracharya is lagging. More interestingly, the Nepali Congress symbol on the ballot has drawn more votes than the Maoist Centre’s symbol. As of Sunday morning, the Maoist Centre received 167 votes for the deputy mayor, but the Congress sign has received 311 votes. Because the Congress party does not have any candidate for the position, the votes will be deemed invalid.  This shows the  ruling parties’ electoral alliance  has not worked in many places.",political
Local elections: Some independent and rebel candidates also steal the show along with major forces’ picks,"Kathmandu, May 14 Election officials in most of the local units that  held local elections  on Friday have begun counting the votes by Saturday morning.

As the vote count progresses, the two biggest parties–Nepali Congress and CPN-UML–are leading in most places. Besides the CPN-Maoist Centre, CPN-Unified Socialist, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal, the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party is also closely following these forces in a few places. Likewise, in some key local units, independent candidates who had revolted against their party’s decisions to partner with other parties have taken the lead. These include Manoj Sah in  Janakpur  (Dhanusha) and Bidur Basnet in  Dhulikhel  (Kavre). Both the Nepali Congress supporters had contested independently against their party’s decision to form an alliance and give the mayoral position to other parties.

"Commission wanted CCTV cameras in all 753 vote counting centres, but it’s possible in around 300 places only","Kathmandu, May 11 The  Election Commission  says it wanted  CCTV cameras in all 753 vote counting centres  across the country for the local elections to be held this Friday, but it did not become possible. The commission says monitoring with the cameras would be possible in only around 300 places only as the local governments could not manage them. “We couldn’t provide CCTV cameras on our own and some local governments said they could not do it either,” Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya says.  Further, a lack of uninterrupted electricity and internet in some remote districts resulted in the problem, according to him. Whenever CCTV monitoring cannot be possible, the officials will be asked to keep video records of the counting process so that they can be used whenever any dispute arises.

Peaceful elections in Nepal: An achievement of democratic practices for 75 years,"On March 29, 2008, a bomb explosion at a mosque in Biratnagar killed two and injured several. The responsibility for the explosion was taken by a group called Nepal Defence Army. Why did they do it? To create havoc in the country before the 2008 constituent assembly elections. Likewise, on March 31 of the same year, a pressure cooker bomb exploded at the Nepali Congress’ Sunsari office. On April 2, three people were injured when a bomb was thrown at a passenger bus in Siraha. The same week, candidates from smaller parties in Nepal were kidnapped. This terrified people so much that many decided to stay home until the elections were over. Incidents like this were common in Nepal when elections were around the corner. Peaceful elections were unimaginable. Clashes between rebel groups and the state, explosions, firing and protests were an everyday affair during the 2008 and 2013 elections. Armed rebel groups even went to the polling stations, bearing arms, scaring the general public and threatening them saying they would kill them if they voted. While that was the case before, there are peaceful elections now. On the eve of the elections, there is peace in the country as people can utilise their right to vote. Central police spokesperson SSP Bishnu Kumar KC says a lot of incidents would take place in the country prior to the  silence period , questioning the idea of peaceful elections. He says people would put up bombs around various areas, demolish vehicles of politicians and set fire to things. “But, things are normal now, which is great. In the past, cadres of major political parties would clash together, creating problems. But, this year, things are quiet. I’m confident that this election is going to be the most peaceful election in years,” says KC. Former DIG Hemanta Malla Thakuri thinks things are better right now because there is a coalition between major parties. “Political parties are cooperating with each other everywhere. That has obviously helped keep things calm and make peaceful elections happen,” adds Thakuri. Thakuri feels social media has also helped people as they cannot go and misbehave as they please. As things can be recorded on the phone and put up on social media, there is a risk of the party being defamed before the election. “In the past, incidents were limited to a place. But, now, if anything happens in Dang, people in Kathmandu or Jhapa will also know about it. And, that has made people alert,” he says. The  National Investigation Department  (NID) in its report presented to Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand stated that it felt the most threat from Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’ and the people who left his party for the peaceful elections this time. Along with that, the department also singled out former Maoist leader Mohan Baidya and his party, Jaya Krishna Goit and his party, the Terai Mukti Morcha and Nepali Shiva Sena. But, the NID does state there is nothing to worry about today as they are not as active as before. Political analyst Bishnu Dahal says things were not the same before. But, he says that elections in 2008, 2013 and 2017 helped shape things for the current scenario of peaceful elections. “People saw how much power they had. They helped draft the constitution and determined what was right and wrong for them. We had to go through some dark times, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,” says Dahal. And, he is right. No one has opposed the forthcoming local elections so far. Political parties have also not publicly opposed the elections. Prior to this, these were a common affair. “When we had the elections in 2008, the rebels who fought the war joined political parties. They didn’t understand how things were done in peaceful elections and people in power didn’t know how to handle them,” says Dahal. “In 2013, these incidents were less, but still, these rebels did not create a favourable environment for an election. But, now, I think people understand the need for a peaceful election and everyone seems to be on board.” “Prior to the 2013 elections, we had different groups that wanted to obstruct the elections,” says former IGP Kuber Singh Rana. The Home Ministry says that during these years, the risk they faced was trying to curb threats by rebel groups bearing arms. In the 2008 elections, the Maoists went to the polling stations with arms. The ministry says there were over 100 armed groups in the country. But, in 2017, the number of armed groups that were opposing the elections was down to 50. These included groups led by Netra Bikram Chand and CK Raut who had decided not to take part in the elections and staged protests across the country. But both the parties are  contesting the local elections this year . For this year, the Home Ministry’s main concern about peaceful elections is the unhealthy competition between candidates. The ministry says it has prepared a special strategy to deal with this issue. In the past, districts in Terai also posed problems for the government as various rebel groups demanded equal rights in the constitution in terms of citizenship. They exploited bombs and planned to obstruct the elections. With most of them also now in mainstream politics, things are calm. CK Raut, one of the main instigators  getting into the mainstream , has helped a lot, claim experts. Looking at things now, veteran politician Binaya Dwaj Chand is happy as he sees a change in people’s mindsets.  “People have become aware and that plays a huge part in having a peaceful election. Because the environment is peaceful, candidates are also not feeling the pressure they once used to feel,” says Chand. “This was what we had envisioned five decades ago. I’m glad that things have changed.”  Thanks to people’s general awareness, even though there was a lot going on in the world in terms of governance, Nepal for the most part was stuck with a feudalistic mindset that stopped the country from developing.  “This is proof that dictators and violence have no place in today’s world,” adds Chand. There was even a time when political parties gained followers for boycotting the elections. But, those times are long gone, argues political commentator Surendra Labh.  “Since this no longer works, political parties are starting to involve themselves in this democratic practice of peaceful elections,” says Labh. Journalist Chandra Kishore says there is peace because everything is now done through social media. “Altercations happen when people meet in person. But, in today’s age, everything is done online,” he says. “The campaigning is all digital and even arguments are digital.” This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political

Is Nepal ready for the right to reject (NOTA) in voting? Here are some pointers to consider,"Elections are always a centre for controversies with candidates badmouthing and accusing their opponents of various socially and even legally unacceptable activities. In the past elections,  though not happy with the candidates , people had participated and voted for the enlisted candidates. And, it seems that in the local elections too, people will do the same. But, what if you had an option to vote yet not vote for any candidates. This option is known as the  right to reject  or none of the above or NOTA in voting.  But, is NOTA in voting important for the voters? And, does NOTA impact election results? Yes, it has been a viable option practised by many countries and it can be for Nepal too, after careful consideration. But no, NOTA in voting does not impact the election results, but it can be an indication of the need for change.  And, the more important question is whether Nepal is ready for it.  To find the answers, here are some pointers to consider that propel you to think it is indeed a time the country adopted the right to reject or NOTA in voting and why Nepal is lagging. Right to speech and expression is a concept that has been contested from many angles, in recent years. But, when it comes to voting, the very fundamental right to speech and expression has not been explored fully. It has only been debated in terms of one being free to cast their votes for the candidates free of fear, intimidation and biases.  But, what if one is not fully convinced about the listed candidates? Should not voters be free to reject the candidates and demand a new list of candidates? After all, that too accounts for their freedom of speech and expression. Hence, NOTA in voting can and should be an option. As mentioned before, in an election at any given time, there can be many candidates that you might feel are untrustworthy or ineligible. But, when you feel so, what do you do? At that moment, NOTA in voting can be a way out. Rather than being restricted about choosing a candidate that one is not happy about, they rather choose for NOTA or invoke their right to reject them. In this sense, NOTA can be the right alternative for voters who are not convinced about the next possible leadership based on the listed candidates. When there is the option to choose NOTA or the right to reject in an election and if more people are choosing to go with the option, this can be a good indication that there is a need for change in the way the country is holding elections or choosing the candidates. If only a couple of voters invoke their right to reject, it can be a personal opinion. However, when given an option, and when a significant portion of people, say 20 per cent, are choosing NOTA, that means there is something significantly wrong with the way the country has been conducting elections. Such situations beg for the country to change its ways and either change the criteria of candidate selection.  Though NOTA or the right to reject has been debated by thinkers and said to be necessary, it has not been implemented in Nepal. One of the key reasons behind it is the lack of education on the topic. If neither general people nor policymakers are aware of it, there is no chance of people demanding the need for their right to reject. Meanwhile, the legislators will also not make an effort to change the constitution or election act to include the option in one and all major as well as minor elections. People will continue to be stuck to voting for the enlisted ones only. Though the right to reject or NOTA is an alternative option, there is no alternative to what happens if the NOTA is practised and the election gets more such votes than any other candidate. The country is first yet to discuss if it needs to include NOTA in its elections. So, it is far from discussing how to move forward. It will take years before Nepal actually gets the option and is enabled to practise it well. As there are a few ways NOTA can be practised, the country further needs to explore what practice suits it the best. Whether the votes will affect the election system or not, what will happen to the votes if there are more NOTA votes and in the situation, what happens to the incumbent government. Nepal is already guilty of having an unstable government that has changed like the seasons. In recent years, it is yet to achieve the feat of having a stable elected government throughout its tenure. So if Nepal, in this situation, includes NOTA in its election system, the country will further fall into instability. When the election fails to choose a new government, and there is a need for re-election, the gap widens creating more instability.  The re-election also demands the use of more taxpayers’ money or government reserve. One election is already a costly affair, so conducting another will further add the economic burden on the nation, which will lead the nation to further instability. Though the right to reject or NOTA is not practised here in Nepal, it is not a new concept. There are different ways of practice in NOTA and some are as follows: Leaving ballot papers blank is mostly regarded as a statistical measure of a candidate’s unpopularity.  It can be argued that a form of it is already practised here with voters leaving ballot papers blank. But, it is not officially practised, nor its repercussions have been explored, so a lot is still up for debate.  When the majority of the people leave the ballot empty/vote for NOTA, ideally, the officials should consider it as an exercise of the right to reject and should reopen nominations so that the voters can get more candidates to choose from. In this format, the right to reject (NOTA) is included as an option along with the candidate list on the official ballot paper. Having it as an option would prevent the circumstances where the voters would have to choose between worse candidates in favour of the reselection of new, probably more capable and favourable candidates. NOTA ballots are accepted in countries Colombia, Ukraine, Brazil, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Finland, Spain, Sweden, Chile, France, Belgium, and Greece. In a few situations, the United States authorises it as well. Some organisations around the world have formed NOTA parties. A variation of that can be seen in Russia and Ukraine among others. In this format, when people do not vote for registered candidates, they get to choose from the NOTA candidates.",political

"The local election code of conduct is strict, but it’s on paper only","On April 28, Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand and State Minister for Health and Population Umesh Shrestha arrived in Chitwan to persuade Nepali Congress leader Jagannath Paudel to withdraw his nomination from the mayor of Bharatpur. The home minister’s request to withdraw his candidacy was not a request; it was a warning. To pressurise independent candidates to withdraw their nominations during the elections is against the  code of conduct set by the Election Commission . But, the commission did not ask for any clarification. Why? Khand and Shrestha allegedly told the commission that they were going to Chitwan for personal reasons. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was also in the act. Before leaving for Chitwan, Deuba, who is Nepali Congress’ president, had informed the commission about his visit. He had told the commission that it was a personal visit and he would not be wasting government resources. But, he did not fulfil his promise to the commission and attended a programme held by his coalition. The examples above show how people in power are making a mockery out of the commission’s code of conduct. Despite the code clearly stating the prime minister, sitting ministers and state government officials cannot be involved in the election campaigns, they continue to disregard this and do as they feel, which has people questioning if the code of conduct is only limited to paper as all the commission does is ask people for clarification. But, the commission says it is doing its best. On May 3, it sought clarification from nine people taking the total to 37. That is all that the commission is doing. At a time when it needed to take and stand and take action, it is allowing those in power to do as they please.  UML’s candidate for the post of Kathmandu’s mayor Keshav Sthapit made a  controversial statement against a young woman  who asked him a question about women accusing him of  sexual harassment . The commission had asked for an explanation, but he held his ground as he repeatedly blamed others for trying to defame him. Election Commissioner Ram Prasad Bhandari says the commission had predicted a few things that would happen. He says the commission is aware that political parties and candidates will do things that will violate its code of conduct. But, what is happening is shocking the commission too. Amrit Khanal, ward 10 chair candidate of Melamchi municipality, was seen bowing down with a Rs 1,000 note. The photo went viral on social media. A source at the commission says it has received this complaint along with others where candidates and political parties are violating the commission’s code of conduct. Deuba’s wife  Arzu Rana Deuba in Dadeldura  on May 5 warned the government would not release the budget if candidates from the Nepali Congress do not win. She urged people not to vote for other parties too. Even though this is publically happening, the commission’s spokesperson Saligram Sharma Paudyal says the commission is sensitive about its code of conduct. “The commission is too small to monitor everything that is taking place in the country. We are taking action against people,” says Paudyal. The commission has a provision in the code of conduct to allow the promotion of election campaigns only from the candidates of political parties and parties’ official social media accounts. But due to the massive use of social media like Facebook, TikTok and Twitter, it is impossible for the commission for examining every social media account, if the code of conduct has been followed or not.  Thus, the commission has now made arrangements where one can promote any party on social media but without any offence to the rival parties. These incidents and arrangements have shown the ineffectiveness of the provisions in the code of conduct. Advocate Santosh Sigdel says the commission’s code of conduct is cannot be implemented. He says most of what is on it is impossible to follow, which gives candidates and others space to break them. Chapter 3 of the code of conduct clearly states officials working in the central and provincial governments cannot promote candidates or parties. But, that has not been the case as Basudev Ghimire, the mayor of Tilotamma municipality, stated he was a political cadre and took part in the election campaign in his locality. He even said he was ready to face any questions by the Election Commission. The commission did ask for clarification. But, no action was taken against him. Former chief election commissioner Nil Kantha Upreti says it was high time the commission made people like Ghimire take back their statements because it was wrong. “Fifteen years ago, a candidate wasn’t allowed to fly to Andhra Pradesh. This is how strict we need to be,” says Upreti. But in Nepal, the commission itself gave permission to Deuba to take part in the event hosted by the coalition in Chitwan and asked people to vote for Renu Dahal. “We can’t say anything because we gave him the permission. They’re misusing our provisions,” says an official from the commission. Deuba, using state resources, is continuously going to similar events asking people to vote for Nepali Congress candidates. As this has happened, the commission has done nothing about it. The commission has only taken action against people in public offices. People would have taken the officials seriously if they had taken strict action against key leaders, but they do nothing but warn. The Election Commission Act has provisions of making the candidate pay a fine of up to Rs 100,000 and cancellation of candidacy. The commission’s Information Officer Guru Wagle says the decision to cancel the candidacy would be taken only if the commission is confident that the election would not be held in a free, fair and unbiased environment. So far, the commission has decided to cancel the candidature in only two cases. Former chief commissioner Upreti points out that the provisions in the code of conduct should be implemented. Without that, there is a risk of questioning the credibility of the election itself. “Once there is a provision in the code of conduct, it should be monitored and action should be taken in case of violation,” he says.  “There should not be a situation where strict provisions are made but are not implemented. On the contrary, it is better to have flexible provisions that can be implemented. If everyone violates the code of conduct by disobeying, the legitimacy and credibility of the election may be questioned. Such a situation should not be allowed to happen,” says Upreti.

Nepal election guide for a first-time voter in 5 points,"Nepal is holding its second round of local elections after the promulgation of the constitution this Friday (on May 13, 2022). It will be held in six metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolitan cities, 276 municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities. Though it is the second, the elections might be a new experience for first-time voters.  As a first-time voter, you might not know or be confused about how to vote or  what to do  in general around the elections. Voting is your right, but knowing how to vote is your responsibility too. As the local elections are coming up, here are a few things to understand as first-time voters. Not only as a first-time voter but as a voter in general, your responsibility in the elections starts even before the election day. As the elections near, candidates are busy campaigning for votes. So, either online or from the website of the Election Commission, try to get the list of candidates for the elections, in your respective locality.  Similarly, before you vote for candidates, you should know which electoral symbols they have been assigned. There are a few popular ones including those assigned to major political parties such as CPN-UML’s sun and Nepali Congress’ tree. Likewise, the CPN-Maoist Centre electoral symbol is a sickle and a hammer inside a circle. Similarly, independent candidates who have registered with the  commission  have received their individual election symbols. Some of the key symbols of the candidates are walking stick, aankhijhyal (latticed window), scissors, et cetera. Whoever you vote for, as a first-time voter, you need to know all your partisan as well as independent candidates and their election symbols so that you can vote for candidates you want to vote for among those on the ballot paper. Along with that, the first-time voters also need to know what positions they need to vote for. In the upcoming local elections, you will be voting for  seven positions .  You will be voting for a mayor/chair and a deputy mayor/deputy chair at each municipality/ rural municipality level. Local units are further split into wards. So in each ward, you will be voting for a ward chair and four members, two of whom must be women with one woman being from the Dalit community.  A code of conduct refers to all of the rules and regulations that participants in the election process–including the government, political parties, candidates, and those who vote for them–must follow. This is done to guarantee that everyone participates in the election as a responsible citizen and in a peaceful way. Hence, the first-time voters also need to know about this. Here are some rules and regulations for voting:  Voting  in the next local elections is rather straightforward and you do not need to worry although you are a first-time voter. Make sure you have a voting card before the election day. If you do not but are sure that your name is there on the voter’s list, you might carry a citizenship certificate instead.  When you arrive at your polling booth, you will be given a ballot and a stamp to select your party member for the relevant posts and you should only use a swastika stamp, in a clear manner. Don’t forget to put a stamp on each part of the ballot paper. For the forthcoming municipal elections, there are seven areas on a single voting paper, and you should stamp one in each sector. Keep in mind the electoral symbols of your preferred candidates and fold the paper in a clear manner. Otherwise, you will wind up voting for someone else. When it comes to counting votes, the Election Commission adheres to particular standards. You must provide a clear vote for your preferred candidate. While using the stamp, do not touch the lines around the box while filling out your ballot. The stamp should be put in the centre of the cell, with the stamps touching the lines from right, left, up, or down.  You need to put only one stamp per column or position, so keep that in mind and choose the electoral symbols of your preferred candidates. Otherwise, your votes might  turn invalid , and we know, as a first-time voter, you do not want your vote to not be counted.",political
New parliament session to begin on May 17,"Kathmandu, May 8 The government has decided to summon the new parliament session to begin on May 17. A minister says the cabinet meeting held on Sunday made the decision. As per the  constitution , the president would summon the new session of the federal parliament as recommended by the government. The new session will be known as the budget session as the government has to table the new budget plan for the next fiscal year during this session. The constitution requires the government to table the new budget plan on May 29 whereas it also has to discuss the annual policy and programme before that.

Election Commission probing Arzu Rana Deuba’s no-budget statement,"Kathmandu, May 8 The  Election Commission  says it has launched an investigation into the controversial statement of Nepali Congress leader Arzu Rana Deuba in which she has said the government will not release any budget to the local units that do not have the Nepali Congress leadership. The statement made by Rana Deuba, who is also the spouse of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, is apparently a breach of the local election code of conduct and abuse of authority.  As reported, she had appealed to the voters in the Dadeldhura district to not vote for a particular independent candidate. The commission says it has assigned an undersecretary to look into the issue and it is preparing to ask her for clarification on Sunday itself. A commission official says Arzu Rana Deuba has made a second statement also that contradicts the election code of conduct. The leader in Kailali had said she would send some of the people supporting her during the election campaign to Malaysia for jobs free of cost.",political
Nepal local elections: Number of candidates elected unopposed hits 390,"Kathmandu, May 8 The  Election Commission  says 390 local officials have been elected unopposed in the 2022 local elections. Whereas voting is scheduled to be held this Friday, the commission says 390 people are being elected unanimously as only one person filed a nomination for each of these positions. Earlier this week, the commission had said the number was  at least 335 . The commission, however, corrected the data in its  regular bulletin  on Saturday. Meanwhile, the commission says at least 170 wards of the country did not receive any nomination for one Dalit woman ward member reserved in the ward committee for the local elections this year. These vacant wards also include at least  26 wards in the Kathmandu valley .",political
Is money the only means to win the elections in Nepal?,"Dolakha’s  Shailung rural municipality  has been one of the best local units in the country. Even though the area is quite remote, the work done by the elected representatives of the rural municipality has been lauded by everyone, even the Office of the Auditor-General. The representatives have improved the living standard, promoted agriculture and developed the place as a tourist destination too. Since the locals like the work of the officials so much, they are asking the chair of the rural municipality, Bharat Prasad Dulal, to recontest in the forthcoming local elections and improve the rural municipality even more. But, for Dulal, this is easier said than done. “I won’t recontest,” says Dulal. “I spent around Rs 4 million during last the election. This time, it’s going to cost even more. I’m still paying the loans I took for the last election. There is no way I will contest because I don’t have that kind of money.” This shows how money plays an important role in the elections in Nepal. Experts say it costs more money to contest local elections than it does at the central and provincial levels. People take loans at extortionate rates to try to win the elections which poses an important ethical question: Can only people with money contest elections in Nepal? To curb this, the  Election Commission has set a spending limit  for candidates. But, most candidates spend a lot more than this not because they want to but because they have to. According to the commission, a mayoral candidate of a metropolitan city cannot spend more than Rs 750,000. When it comes to a sub-metropolitan city, a mayoral candidate can only spend Rs 550,000. For municipalities, the number is set at Rs 450,000 and for rural municipalities, the ceiling is set at Rs 350,000. According to a study  conducted by the  Asia Foundation , the candidates in the 2017 elections in Nepal had spent up to 136 per cent more by trampling the limits set by the commission. Expenses incurred in this way are not transparent or are hidden and they even lie while submitting expenditure details to the Election Commission. Krishna Prasad Sapkota, elected from Kavre in the first Constituent Assembly, says almost all candidates spend more than the limit set by the commission. He says even the commission knows this, but the commission still accepts the fabricated details provided by the candidates. And, he is right. According to the study by Asia Foundation, candidates spent over Rs 50 billion during the 2017 local elections. The study adds around Rs 50.95 billion had been spent in the 2017 elections in Nepal–including local, provincial and federal ones. The report of the Election Observation Committee also revealed the expenditure which stated that the parties, candidates and party well-wishers spent about Rs 5,000 per voter, or about Rs 70 billion in the federal, provincial and local elections in Nepal in 2017. This is not a transparent expenditure. The cost was done to impress the electorate. Gajendra Bahadur Mahat, a first-past-the-post member of the House of Representatives from Jumla, sheds light on the issue. He says the candidates have to spend on both the voters and party cadres. “During the time of elections in Nepal, we have to spend on the cadres who support us and the voters who vote for us. Why? Because there is a belief system that since candidates are desperate, they will offer anything be it money or fuel or goods,” says Mahat. Former Chief Election Commissioner Bhoj Raj Pokhrel, who has been raising his voice for the reform of the electoral system, has prepared a long report regarding the distortion. “Candidates that appear out of the blue are the ones spending more during elections in Nepal than what the commission sets,” he writes in his report prepared for the  Policy Research Institute . “And since they spend so much money, they practically buy votes and win the election too.” He says the distortion also takes place because people who win the elections start amassing money for the next election so they can repeat the same thing and win again. This, Pokharel believes, will institutionalise corruption in the country as elected representatives work under the influence of interest groups who promise to help them in the next election too. “This will throw good governance out of the window,” he says. Many party leaders feel elections in Nepal are rigged since there is no monitoring of how much a person can spend. “The Election Commission should monitor each candidate and how much the person is spending,” says Ashta Laxmi Shakya, vice-chair of the CPN-UML. “We need a stricter policy.” She further argues discussions should be initiated on if the country should implement the proportional representational system. “Now, it seems that the electoral system should be discussed and we should go for a proportional representational system.” Former commissioner Pokharel says there is hope for change. But for that, he believes all candidates should submit their source of money in advance. He says if the person cannot show a valid source or is helped by a donor, penalties should be levied on the party and its candidate. This can happen by including a no vote provision on the ballot paper itself, argues Pokharel. Likewise, he says elections in Nepal could be improved by reducing the number of people elected at the centre, allocating seats in proportional representation only to those who are really lagging behind in proportional representation, and letting only independent candidates contest at the local level.  “The government should provide grants based on the criteria set for the management of the party’s expenses. Apart from that, the commission should also ask for the amount a donor offers to party throughout the year. This will help them keep things in check,” says Pokharel. Since it is so expensive to contest elections in Nepal, many like Dulal from Shailung rural municipality, are not contesting the  local elections this time  even though they have the potential to lead. Giriraj Mani Pokharel, a central committee member of the CPN-Maoist Centre, agrees people without money cannot contest elections. He says this is why the country sees businesspersons getting into politics. “A candidate needs money to contest elections in Nepal. It’s a sad reality that people who worked hard and fought to change this rarely get to contest elections,” the Maoist leader says. Like Dulal, Gajendra Bahadur Mahat from Jumla also does not want to contest the coming elections. He believes that the cost to win outweighs the return. “I spent Rs 6 million last time. The only way I get that kind of money is if I take help from businesspersons. And when I do that, I will have to help them out,” says Mahat, adding he does not want to be influenced in any way. In the 2017 election, CPN-UML Vice-Chairman Yubaraj Gyawali refused to contest for financial reasons. He feared that if he did contest, he needed to take help from the capitalists and not wanting to do so decided to stay away from it.  “Many people go through this and we need to change it,” says Shakya.  This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Reviewing Bidya Sundar Shakya’s leadership in Kathmandu: More controversies than achievements,"Before being elected as the mayor of Kathmandu, Bidya Sundar Shakya had said that he would change the face of the city. “I’ll make sure we complete 101 things in 100 days,” he said before being elected. Believing in his vision, people voted for him as he  became the mayor of Kathmandu  with Hari Prabha Khadgi from Nepali Congress as his deputy. It has been over 1,800 days since the two were elected by the people of Kathmandu metropolitan city. But during this time, they have not been able to work as effectively as they had promised with the  city government  failing to complete major projects it had planned. Kishor Thapa, who had contested the mayoral elections with Bidya Sundar Shakya feels that the leadership at KMC has failed the citizens of the city. “The city should have become a beacon of hope for the other local units in the country. But, it did nothing in the five years. It could have changed the development model of the city, but they didn’t even try,” says Thapa. During Shakya and Khadgi’s tenure, the KMC has not been able to spend more than Rs 5 billion. The money the KMC has not been able to spend on development work has been put in a fixed deposit account as it gains interest out of it. At a time when spending has gone down, the city’s arrears have gone up and stands at Rs 4.48 billion, states a report prepared by the Office of the Auditor-General.  Bidya Sundar Shakya, in his election manifesto, had promised to build a monorail around the ring road. He also had an ambitious plan of starting a metro train service in Kathmandu. He said he would do it within three years of his term. A team of Chinese engineers had even studied the possibility of setting up a monorail. But after experts warned of the project being a white elephant, Shakya dropped the idea. “The KMC’s focus should have been on developing the city’s transportation system. They didn’t work enough on it,” adds Thapa. Apart from the monorail project, Shakya had other projects too that would have been completed within his five-year tenure if he had pushed hard. Bidya Sundar Shakya had the vision to make Kathmandu a cycling city. To push it, he even hopped on a bicycle. But in the five years, the  city was not even able to make a cycle lane . This was embarrassing for Shakya as his counterpart in Lalitpur was successful if  making a cycle lane in the metropolitan city . Another candidate who lost to Shakya was Pavitra Man Bajracharya. He says that Shakya even failed to work towards making Kathmandu a better commercial city.  “We could’ve made the city favourable for businesses and consumers. But, they didn’t work efficiently,” says Bajracharya. Deputy mayor Hari Prabha Khadgi accepts that the city officials did not work effectively enough when it came to monitoring the market. “We’ve recently passed an act regarding market monitoring,” she says.  The city government had a plan to build a commercial building at Dharma Path too. But even that did not go ahead. Instead, a complaint was filed at the CIAA accusing KMC officials of working in cahoots with traders to build an administrative building in Teku. They were also criticised for trying to demolish the historical Bagdurbar.  There was also a plan on starting a smart vertical car parking and vehicle-free zone. Both projects did not start. The KMC instead gave the responsibility of managing parking in the New Road area to a private company. It was free before this. The Bidya Sundar Shakya-led KMC was also weak when it came to coordinating with other sectors of government. The central government had sent a secretary to work with the KMC when it came to development work. But, Shakya said he did not need a secretary and that a joint secretary would be enough. Following that, the government removed the position of secretary from the KMC. Former secretary Dipendra Nath Sharma says that the KMC should have taken Kathmandu Valley Development Authority as a facilitator and worked on development projects. Unless coordination on this level does not happen in the city, nothing will change, says Sharma. “We still work like we’re in the Panchyat era,” he says. The city government had also planned to cover the potholes in the city and make it dust-free. But, that also has not happened as the city is only the most polluted in the world.  One thing the KMC officials including Bidya Sundar Shakya have been able to do is to be in the news for the wrong reason. The municipal government’s first meeting came under scrutiny after it decided to use the city’s budget to buy smartphones. The staff also started to take out as much money as they wanted in the name of salaries and other allowances. They also faced a lot of criticism when they decided to demonish the old bus park to build a commercial building which to date has not been completed. The local government shifted one of the biggest bus stations in the city to Khulamanch. But, after the contractors built shutters and leased them, the city office and Shakya faced heavy criticism. Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya had said he would set up a food bank too. But during Covid, when humanitarians were distributing free food, Shakya  told humanitarians not to do that at Khulamanch . Shakya was criticised by the Newa community who did not like how he had commissioned reconstruction projects like  Ranipokhari ,  Kamalpokhari ,  Kasthamandap  and Bagdurbar. Number two on his election manifesto was the reconstruction of the Sorakhutte Pati. He has not talked about it since he was elected. The manner in which road expansion was done also shows how bad a leader Bidya Sundar Shakya was. He had said he would make sure to listen to the people. But, during the expansions of the Balaju Bypass road, many people lost their homes and the KMC did nothing about it. Shakya knows he could not do much work when it came to infrastructure development. But, he says he has done good work when it came to the development of society. He initiated a yearly allowance of Rs 12,000 for elderly people over the age of 84 and Rs 3,000 for differently-abled citizens per month. However, it was discontinued, the reason being the KMC losing its money.  The city government has also talked about deploying volunteers to help senior citizens. But, the only thing it did was send the volunteers last year for health checkups of people over the age of 84. The only thing that did garner him praise was how he started a collaboration with Manav Sewa Ashram to help people living on the road. Like every politician, Bidya Sundar Shakya and Hari Prabha Khadgi also promised a corruption-free city. But, that did not happen. Both were actively  handing out aid to the organisations  they were close with as they handed out aid to organisations opened in the name of CPN-UML and Nepali Congress leaders. The city in the fiscal year 2020/21 alone handed out aid in excess of Rs 226 million each to over 25 organisations. Despite having a hall, the municipal government conducted most meetings and events in five-star hotels. Bidya Sundar Shakya and Hari Prabha Khadgi would have left behind a legacy had they cleaned the city. But, during their time, waste management has been dire as the city stinks more. There had been talking about privatising waste management. But, this did  not move forward  even in the past five years. Two campaigns – Clean the city and No Mask City – were envisioned. But, they did not materialise.  They had planned to ask the people of the city to compulsorily  harvest rainwater  and  recharge the city’s groundwater . But, there was not any initiation of their implementation. The city officials were not able to manage the  roadside vendors  who over the past few years have been treated like stray dogs by the city officials as metropolitan police regularly harass them. The city’s internal revenue in the four years has increased to Rs 8 billion from Rs 3 billion. Despite this, the city increased the tax rates.  “People who didn’t pay tax continued to not pay tax. But, people who paid taxes had to pay more. This is unfair,” says Bajracharya. When it comes to justice, nonetheless, the Kathmandu metropolitan city has been doing good. The judicial committee has been solving around 300 disputes every year. Currently, there are only 75 complaints at the city office.  The Bidya Sundar Shakya-led city has done some good work too. The city office played an important role in the promotion of Nepal Bhasa in schools in the city. But, it could have done more to improve the quality of education in government and community schools, but this is seen as a positive thing. The city office is also building a fire station in Basbhari along with starting health insurance for the elderly. Health clinics were also established in all remaining wards of the city. The KMC also helped to set up a dialysis service at  Birendra Sainik Hospital . During Covid, the KMC donated 46 ventilators to government and community hospitals. But, Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya was criticised for staying at Soaltee Hotel when he contracted Covid. People say he could have done more to help the people of the city. The KMC has also stepped up efforts to reconstruct ward offices using traditional building methods. It has also started to construct parks around the city. Around 50 parks are being constructed right now. This story was translated from the  original Nepali version  and edited for clarity and length.",political
Security of small nations such as Nepal: Concerns raised by the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"Despite being a small nation, Nepal has  protested the Russian invasion of Ukraine  this time. This drew the attention of the international world as its big neighbours–India and China– abstained from a crucial UN vote  about the issue. However, critically analysing, Nepal’s move stems from the concerns it has about the security of small nations such as itself.  The western leaders are addressing the Russian invasion as ‘unprovoked’. The Russian and Eastern pundits, however, are tracing events that left Russia no choice but to start the military intervention. Whatever be the reasons or justifications and their validity, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has posed a larger question about the functioning of the entire world order. The concerns are not bound to a single event of Russian invasion of Ukraine but its effects and indications can be seen in future dealings with other nations. One such concern is the security of small nations that are in proximity to great military-nuclear powers or their area of interest. Small nations refer to the nations with a relatively small territory, weak military or economic power and no nuclear weapons. Hakan Wiberg, Lund University Peace Research Institute, writes there are  two notions of small nations : absolute and relative. The absolute notion entails objective indicators such as population, area, economic indicators, military indicators, etc. Relative notions entail ‘smallness’ as a lack of influence on or high sensitivity to or lack of immunity from influences. Ukraine is the second-largest European nation, but it is vulnerable and prone to intervention from the relatively large and nuclear nation, Russia. Small nations have historically been vulnerable to military attack and their sovereignty being compromised, especially the ones in proximity to large nations. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait (1990), the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Lebanon, the collation invasion of Iraq (2003), the Russian invasion of Georgia (2008), and the Russian invasion of Ukraine (2014 and 2022) are some recent large scale examples.  Mostly superpowers such as the USA, UK, France, China, Russia etc are involved in direct or indirect threats to the security of small nations. Historians Christopher Kelly and Stuart Laycock, in their book, America Invades: How We’ve Invaded or Been Militarily Involved with Almost Every Country on Earth, mention the United States has  invaded or operated militarily in 84 of the 193 UN-recognised nations . When Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, The UN Security Council passed a  resolution  on direct military intervention to liberate Kuwait which led to ousting of the Iraqi forces and restoration of the sovereignty of Kuwait.  The UNSC has the mandate from UN Charter to authorise such military intervention. The UNSC cannot be expected to take a fraction of the measures taken during the Gulf war in the present invasion of Ukraine because Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC with veto power, a strong military and most notably has nuclear weapons. No international personality is willing to directly confront such nations to protect the security of the small nation due to fear of prolonged conflict and ‘nuclear Armageddon.’ The precedent can be seen in the US invasion of Iraq (2003), against which the largest protest around the world occurred before the invasion and the then UN secretary-general condemned the invasion as illegal after it started. Still, the US military stayed in Iraq up to 2011. The USA had great political influence and it is still the largest funder of the United Nations. The International Court of Justice, adjudicating the case Nicaragua v the United Nations, held that the USA was in breach of its obligations under customary international law not to use force against another nation, not to intervene in its affairs, and not to violate its sovereignty. The ICJ ruled in favour of Nicaragua, a small nation, stating the supply of weapons to rebels by the USA within the territory of Nicaragua is illegal.  The ICJ has precise rules for Jurisdiction and it cannot adjudicate without the consent of parties. Moreover, when the ICJ gave an order stating the USA should ensure that its sanctions against Iran should not restrict humanitarian aid or compromise civil aviation safety on October 3, 2018, the USA claimed the ICJ had become ‘ineffective and politicised’ and withdrew from the ICJ Optional Protocol, which establishes jurisdiction. The only way, hence, is to align with alternate power. During the Korean War (1950-1953), South Korea was supported by US-led UN forces whereas North Korea’s existence was ensured by the direct intervention of China. The Communist government in Cuba was aided and protected by the USSR which led to its existence throughout the Cold War. During the Cold War, many nations sided with either superpower to protect themselves and reap benefits from their hostility, but many nations were plunged into civil war or their government was disposed of by coups perpetrated by either side of the cold war.  As shown by the Russian invasion of Ukraine twice, aligning with alternate power does not guarantee security. Moreover, if the invading nation has nuclear weapons, the support by alternate power is always indirect, fuelling civil wars as seen in Afghanistan, Vietnam and the Latin American Nations. The USA and USSR never faced each other in a direct military confrontation during the entire Cold War of 45 years. One of the most concerning implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine is its effect on the mindset and future dealings of nuclear nations in dispute with non-nuclear nations. China has numerous disputes in the South China Sea, especially with Vietnam and the Philippines. Israel is consistently encroaching on the remaining Palestinian territory in West Bank and Gaza Strip. India has a military presence in Kalapani of Nepal.  The impunity of action and no deterrence from economic sanctions may motivate nations like Israel, China, India and other regional powers to follow same footsteps, concerning nations like Taiwan, Palestine, Lebanon, Nepal and Baltic states. The concern is not that these nations have become more likely to invade smaller nations like Russia, but these nuclear nations may take a more aggressive stance in disputes with small nations. There has been an infinite amount of small encroachment on small nations by neighbouring big nations. Nepal alone faces  territorial encroachment  at 71 places throughout the 1,880km border with India and two places throughout the 1,440km border with China, not to mention the meddling in domestic politics and internal affairs. In this scenario, the present Russian invasion of Ukraine demands an answer to the question of sovereignty and security of small nations such as Nepal more than ever. The frequent political, military and economic aggression towards them has challenged the world community to answer, how and who protects the sovereignty and security of small nations in case of encroachment by large and nuclear nations.  The present international legal order will fail if it cannot cure the old disease of the international arena – the Matsya Nyaya, the big constantly encroaching on the small. This context demands a framing of a new mechanism to protect the security and sovereignty of small nations.  Nepal as a small nation, sandwiched between two nuclear powers India and China, should examine the context and implication of the present Russian invasion thoroughly for determining its take on the invasion and pave its future foreign policy.",political

Narendra Modi to come to Lumbini in Nepal to celebrate Buddha Jayanti,"Kathmandu, May 6 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming to Nepal on May 16.

The government has already started preparations to welcome the Indian premier. Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba will fly to Lumbini to welcome Modi who is unlikely to come to Kathmandu. It is likely that Modi will also lay the foundation stone to build a monastery in the area. Over the past decades, many countries have built monasteries around Lumbini.

Physical to digital: Election campaigns in Nepal undergo several changes over 6 decades,"As social media have become a part of everyone’s daily life, the  Election Commission (EC)  is tapping into its strength for its election campaigns to spread awareness about the forthcoming  local elections  scheduled for May 13. On Sunday, the commission  called for social media users  and announced that people sharing the content prepared by the commission will get a chance to win cash prizes. It stated that the commission will give people a cash prize of Rs 20,000, Rs 30,000 and Rs 50,000 to a person who gets two million, three million and five million views on the video they share respectively. This goes to show the efforts the commission is putting to ensure that its message reaches a wider audience. However, this is not the first time that the commission has reached out to the general public to convey its message of the election. In the first general election held in 1958, the commission took help from selected lyricists, singers, poets and writers to spread information about the elections. The then Election Campaign Department gave the task of composing songs to poets Dharma Raj Thapa and Ram Chandra Prasad to convey the message about the elections. Likewise, 5,000 copies of the book, Nirwachanko Sawai (Verses of the Elections), by Laxman Lohani were published and distributed free of charge, which has been mentioned in the book Rastriya Nirwachan Prachar Samagri (National Election Campaign Materials), edited by Deepak Aryal and Kapil Timilsina for Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya. Apart from that, mock elections were conducted in various districts, pamphlets were distributed, and then singers were sent to the villages to promote the elections through folk songs. The then Chief Election Commissioner Subarna SJB Rana emphasised these activities to inform the voters about the elections. Compared to the earlier years, the major difference is in the promotion of elections this time is the use of technology while disseminating information. Using what is available, the commission has given its utmost priority to social media through which it has been conveying its decisions, appeals and instructions to both the general public and the candidates. The commission has also chosen caller back tones for voter education. Since the mass media was in its nascent phase and social media did not exist, election campaigns were done physically till the 1990s. Although municipal elections were held in 1947 and 1953, the 1958 general elections were the first to get recognised widely in the country. The election campaign that time took place almost a year before the general elections. Folk poet Ram Chandra Prasad even wrote a song for the elections on March 31, 1957. This shows how the election campaign material was prepared seven months before the actual elections. Moreover, the government also published a fortnightly magazine called Nirwachan Sandesh which gave a clear idea of the time taken for the campaign. At that time, the parties had many challenges while promoting themselves. The party leaders and cadres themselves visited houses of people to seek votes in their favour through folk songs, poems and dramas. Also, the timing of the voting and the announcement of the results of the 1958 elections suggests difficulty for the commission and the political parties to campaign at that time. The election time had to change many times and after the elections, it took two and a half months for the results. During the Panchayat period, the election campaigning style of leaders remained the same as they would go door to door asking for votes. Like in the late 50s, politicians took the help of songs, music and drama. Apart from that, they also held rallies, distributed pamphlets and took the help of graffiti during their campaigns. Leaders say that the style of using the picture of the candidates in the pamphlets prevailed after the referendum of 1979. Leaders still remember the election campaigning style adopted by Padma Ratna Tuladhar when he contested the elections in 1986.  Tuladhar’s  speech given at Basantapur Dabali  was even taped and played in other parts of Kathmandu. “He won the election with the help of the same speech delivered in the streets of Kathmandu in a recorded form,” says Komal Bhattarai, a leader of the student movement of 1979. Following the 1991 elections, political parties adopted the style of posting pamphlets, painting graffiti and holding public meetings to reach as many voters as they could. Likewise, in the local elections of 1992 and 1997, and in the parliamentary elections of 1994 and 1995, physical presence was the main means of party promotion. However, after the 2006 People’s Movement, election campaigns of political parties have been gradually changing. Even today, candidates continue to go door to door asking for votes. But, apart from that, their main focus has been using technology and social media to campaign. “We also do programmes with physical participation, but we give priority to publicity through social media,” says Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat. With the increasing expansion of the internet and electricity, the parties are using social networks to reach the masses for the elections. The importance given to social media and the warnings given in the  code of conduct  issued by the Election Commission for the upcoming local elections further highlights its importance. Six of the 20 points that should not be done during the election period under the code of conduct for all are focused on the use of social media. Those points have restricted parties to create any content and share them that could violate the election process. Apart from this, the method of using social media has been specified in the code of conduct for those in public bodies under different headings. In addition to this, the commission issued a separate  statement on the use of social media  on April 29. “If any political party or candidate is found making a political advertisement on social media without the approval of the commission or the office of the concerned election officer, it will be treated as a violation of the code of conduct,” the statement says. The reason for issuing such a statement 13 days after the issuance of the code of conduct is that almost all the candidates prefer to use social media and campaign in their favour, something that was not imagined six decades ago.

"Nepal Police chief appointment row: No interim order, next hearing after local elections only","Kathmandu, May 5 The  Supreme Court  has denied issuing an interim order that could bar the new Nepal Police chief Dhiraj Pratap Singh from working. AIG Bishwa Raj Pokharel, who was also in a race to the top job, had  filed a writ petition  at the court demanding such an order. But, a single bench of Justice Sushmalata Mathema did not give the interim order stating Singh has already started working. However, since the question raised by Pokharel are valid for legal consideration, the bench says the issue will be heard further. The next hearing would take place on May 31 only, according to the verdict issued today.  The government had  appointed Singh  to the position of Nepal Police chief on Sunday. The decision turned controversial as a violation of the seniority order in the national police organisation.  Bishwa Raj Pokharel was in the first rank  and Dhiraj Pratap Singh in the third.",political
"Local elections: 41% of candidates are under 40, but nonagenarians are also fighting","Kathmandu, May 5 The number of young candidates contesting the upcoming  local elections  compared to last time is quite high.  According to the  Election Commission , 41 per cent of the total candidates are under the age of 40. This shows how young people are wanting to take charge of the country.

According to the commission’s data, around 10,000 people over the age of 60 are contesting the election. There are 412 people aged 21 contesting the local elections and a total of 15,960 people aged 30 or under are up to take charge of their locality.

Balen for Kathmandu mayor: Your FAQs answered,"Balen, a rapper and engineer, has stirred some controversy since announcing his candidacy for  the mayor of Kathmandu  metropolitan city. His popularity is growing day by day. He has appeared in a variety of media outlets and discussed his perspective.  Kathmandu , the largest city in Nepal in terms of voters, has already received nominations from over 50 contenders for the position of mayor. But, of them, Balen, sometimes referred to as his real name Balendra Shah, is gaining a lot of attention. However, it is entirely up to the people to decide whether he will win or lose. Here, Onlinekhabar is presenting you with the answers to your frequently asked questions about his candidacy as an  independent candidate .   Balen is one of the renowned figures in the Nepali music scene, especially in the  hip-hop community . He is a rapper and also a structural engineer. His real name is Balendra Shah. In the upcoming local elections, he has filed a nomination for the post of mayor of Kathmandu metropolitan city.  Balen says Nepal’s government system has always disappointed him. The public has to go through a lot of hassles even to acquire simple documents from government offices. According to him, he wants to change this situation. Also, he aspires to upgrade the infrastructure of Kathmandu if he becomes the mayor. For that, he claims that his educational background in structural engineering is an asset. Moreover, the engineer-rapper is also frustrated with the elderly leaders who have been in the topmost position for a long time. His election campaign is, hence, running under the theme #BalenForMayor #AbaYuvaKoPalo [It is now youngers’ turns]”.    The 31-year-old has advocated for social issues through his songs for a long time. However, now, he wants to solve them for real after winning the position of the mayor. Balen says his objective is to create a healthy environment where the public is both mentally and physically well. Likewise, he says his focus will be on the development of education, sanitation and waste management along with the availability of water for all, preserving art and culture, increasing tourism and controlling pollution.  Balen says he expects to get 90,835 votes in the upcoming local elections. He has talked about it in various interviews. His assumption regarding the votes has drawn criticism from different areas, and it also has been labelled illogical. This is probably the biggest thing he has been highly criticised for since his announcement to run for the post of mayor.  He claims that 55 to 60 per cent of voters are neutral and he expects to get the votes from all those neutral individuals.  However, in Nepal, independent candidates rarely win major elections. Hence, political analysts rule out his victory Nonetheless, magic may happen in the world. Hence, you can talk about what happens if he wins the election.  Balen says he does not have lofty promises. Instead, he wants to work on simple things and avoid giant ideas such as monorails.  He intends to start an infrastructured ambulance to keep the city’s infrastructure in good shape. Likewise, he has ambitions to improve educational standards. He promises to make public schools superior to private schools. Rather than the existing regular curriculum, he wants to emphasise practical instruction. He feels that doing so will make it easier for students to find employment and opportunities. In every available industry, he promises to implement cashless transactions. Birth certificates, marriage certificates, and other important documents will also be provided to the residents online.",political
Biplav-led Maoist party splits as dissidents expel him,"Kathmandu, May 4 Members of the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’ have removed Chand as the general secretary of the party, expelling him from the party as well.  It means the party which was on the verge of a division over participation in the local elections has finally split. The group was named Dharmendra Bastola the new chief of the party. Central member Guna Raj Lohani informs the leaders also removed Khadga Bahadur Biswakarma along with Biplav. This comes after Chand and some party leaders  developed differences  over whether to participate in the upcoming  local elections  or not.

"For Bajura Dalits who are dependent on their landlords, voting in the local elections has been a tough choice","An example of how the division in a political party affects the local people can be seen in the Dalit settlement of Jukot,  Swamikartik Khapar  rural municipality-3 in Bajura. Ahead of the  local elections , the Dalit community here is now in trouble due to the  division in the CPN-UML . Before the CPN-UML split, most of the so-called upper-caste landlords–sahus as the Dalits call them–in the Jukot village in Bajura belonged to the CPN-UML. The Dalit community, most of whom owe them labour, lives on their land. Hence, they are forced to vote for their landlords. Although they did not have the freedom to vote, they were not interfered with by any party other than the CPN-UML, in the past. However, due to the CPN-UML split, the entire Jukot village has been divided into two factions, the CPN-UML and the CPN-Unified Socialist. Chaturbhuj Shahi from CPN-UML and Chiranjeevi Shahi from CPN-Unified Socialist have filed candidacies for the post of rural municipality chairman. Chiranjeevi also has the support of the Maoists. He defeated the Nepali Congress in the 2017 local elections and won the chairpersonship. There are also Congress and Maoist leaders in Jukot, but they do not count significantly. A total of 465 families live in Jukot of Bajura including Thakuri and Chhetri communities that have 2,096 voters in the ward. Among them, 218 families are from the Dalit community. The village is divided into two parts and both the presidential candidates are from this ward. This has created a dilemma in the Dalits of the Bajura village about whom they should vote. A local Lok Man Kami says, “We used to cast our votes as directed by sahus, but now, if we support one sahu, the other will get enraged with us. How to vote now, who to follow?” Most of the Dalit families in Jukot of Bajura have been living as haliyas—bounded labourers employed to cultivate the land— for the Thakuri caste whom they address as sahus—landlords. The local haliyas are going to cast their votes by asking the sahus. Otherwise, they have to leave the place where they are settled.  On condition of anonymity, a Dalit voter says, “Both my sahus have split into different parties this year. Now, if I help one, there is fear from the other.” It is a common practice for the local sahus to consider the Dalit settlements in the hilly districts of the far west as their pocket voters. So, even now, local Dalits are forced to cast their votes wherever they go. They are still not allowed to vote freely due to their ethnic domination and influence in their life, socially and economically. “We have been casting our vote in the same place as they recommend us; we will do the same this year,” says Mani BK, a local Dalit leader. “We also lined up to vote in the earlier elections. However, Thakuri would come and snatch the ballot papers from the line and cast our vote. In 2017, it was mandatory for us to cast our vote after showing them whom we had cast the vote for.” Many Dalit communities live in Thulapata, Kadarwada, and Luwarwada Tol of the Bajura district. The practice of treating the Dalit community as slaves is still going on in Bajura. “We are always under pressure,” says Jashu Kadara. Deepak Shah, the health coordinator of Budhiganga municipality, who became the polling officer in the same village in the 2013 Constituent Assembly elections says the Dalit community would not be treated as an independent voter in Bajura. He adds the Dalit families have been compelled to accept what the local Thakuri said. In fact, they had always been deprived of the right to vote in the past. Hence, most do not get to vote even today. Even if one gets it, s/he should cast their vote for the party recommended by their sahus. Not only that, the Dalits of the village still should ask the Thakuri community while conducting their normal social work.

Election Commission to monitor vote counting with CCTV cameras,"Kathmandu, May 3 The  Election Commission  is preparing to monitor vote counting with CCTV cameras to avoid any dispute during the count during the local elections this year.  In the previous elections in 2017, the commission had covered the counting hall with nets to bar candidates and their representatives from any undesirable interference. But this time, as most of the counting places are connected to the internet, the commission’s central office will monitor the count from Kathmandu itself. The commission has already issued a circular to all the election offices across the country to instal CCTV cameras at all counting places. Providing security to vote counting is considered a key challenge in Nepal’s election process as some  ballot papers were torn  by political cadres in Bharatpur of Chitwan in 2017.",political

Invalid votes are a cause for concern every election: 7 things you should do to make your votes count,"In the upcoming local elections, you are going to  cast your votes , but before you step into the polling booth, there are a few things you need to understand about the whole process. In particular, you need to learn about valid and invalid votes.  After all, you do not want your votes to go in vain just because you missed a few key things. We say this because the  Election Commission  has set quite a few criteria for valid and invalid votes.   As an informed citizen, you ought to know the following rules (in order of the voting process), just so that your vote is not tagged as an invalid vote.  When you enter the booth, you will be given the ballot paper on which you will cast your vote. When you receive the paper, first check whether the paper has been signed by the voting officer. If the ballot paper does not have the signature, you are going to cause an invalid vote.  When you reach the polling booth, you will see the swastika stamp and the ink pad to use. This means you do not have to take any pen or marker to cast your vote. In fact, the use of anything other than the swastika stamp will make an invalid vote.  Another major mistake that people tend to make is to cast their vote using their thumbprint, which is also not allowed and will cause your vote to be invalid.  When you use the swastika stamp to cast your vote, make sure that you do not use too much or too little ink. Either of the two will result in your symbol being unreadable and your vote being invalid.  Also, do not smudge the ink or use the stamp twice on the same spot. Choose to vote for the electoral symbol of your desired candidate only. Do not cast a vote for two candidates in a single column. This will result in you casting an invalid vote. So make sure that you are only using one vote and that it is clear to read. When you cast your vote for your candidate, make sure to vote and stay inside the set box. Do not put your stamp outside the box. Make sure that your stamp in the box does not overlap with another, horizontally or vertically. You cannot vote for two candidates or divide your vote. Hence, make sure it is easy and clear to read so that your choice will not be ignored as an invalid vote. Since the ballot paper is a big piece of paper, you will have to fold the paper before you drop the paper into the box. You need to fold the paper also to maintain the secrecy of your vote. But, how you fold the paper can also affect your vote from being valid or invalid. Do not fold the paper in a way the face of the paper is turned outside. Also while folding, make sure that the ink does not get smudged or leave an imprint on any other symbol.  However, depending on where you cast your vote might change how you can fold your ballot paper.  Be mindful of where the ink stamp is and where it can leave an imprint. It is also a good idea to make sure that the ink has dried before you fold the paper. It will save you the trouble of finding ways to fold and not mess up your vote. You are expected to vote for  all seven positions  on your ballot paper for the local elections. However, you can also choose to vote for one or two or as many candidates as you want and leave the rest out. For example, you can choose to vote for your mayor/chairperson and not the rest, or mayor and ward chair but not others, or for deputy mayor and ward members and leave the rest. That will not be considered an invalid vote.  But, even while doing so, you have to follow the aforementioned conditions and choose the candidate you want to vote for, in a clear manner.",political
"26 wards in Kathmandu valley won’t have Dalit women representatives, 16 wards got them unopposed","Kathmandu, May 1 Giving a blow to the principle of social inclusion, 26 wards of various local governments in the Kathmandu valley will not have Dalit women representatives for the next five years. According to the data revealed by the  Election Commission , no Dalit woman filed her candidacy for the ward membership during the  time allocated for that .

On the other hand, only one nomination was filed from the Dalit women for the position in each of the 16 other wards. It means the candidates got elected unanimously.

Independent candidates are flooding local elections. Here are 10 reasons why they are different from the rest,"Lately, it has seen  the whim  of filing  independent candidacy  for the upcoming local elections. People from diverse backgrounds are filing their nominations as independent candidates.  But, people may be confused with  the concept of independent candidacy . If you are one of those, you should read this article. In this post, we have stated 10 points that show how the independent candidates are different from the party-based candidates.   Independent candidates are not restricted by party policies and political ideologies. It means they make the policies on their own. Relatively, these candidates need to put more individual effort into drafting the policies.  A person moving from a person who is unknown or known less by the people to somebody who is well-celebrated everyone can be an independent candidate. They do not need to expect and rely on the party tickets. All they need to do is go to the dedicated election office and file their nomination.  The candidates not affiliated with any party have a greater chance to gain remarkable public support. Since they are supposed to work independently without favouring any party and leaders, people would prefer to support them.  Independent candidates are expected to show no discrimination in terms of serving people. They would give equal priority to everyone. The real and needy people will be their priority once they assume the office as they do not have to hold any political pressure.  Serving someone who has contributed to party politics will be as equal to the general public for them.  Likewise, they will also treat the bureaucrats equally. It does not matter, for them, to which political idealogy the bureaucrats belong. The nature of these candidates can help in running the government’s work smoothly.  The independent candidates do not need to think about building their parties. Once elected, they will be more responsible for their duties as public servants. They do not have to think about the cadres and party leaders who expect a vested interest to be served by them.  Now, some downsides… There is a higher chance that the independent candidates could face a hefty financial burden to run the election campaign. Unlike the partisan candidates, they do not have a political backup that could provide them with financial assistance. Most of the time, they need to rely on their family, friends and supporters to manage their finances.  Relatively, people who file independent candidacies may have a few supporters. This may create difficulties in mobilising the human resources. They may not give sufficient time to their constituency due to a lack of human resources. Likewise, they may also be unable to reach all the parts of their area.   Independent candidates can be an unfamiliar figure for many voters. They can have an identity crisis among the voters. And usually, voters tend to vote only for those who are well known and recognised by society.   In a country like Nepal, there are fewer chances that people filing independent candidacies would emerge victorious in the election. If you look at history as well, there is only a handful of records where an independent candidate has won the election. Most of the voters are deeply rooted in any of the political ideologies and they are reluctant to vote for others.  While most of the political parties would have already recognised  election symbols , things would be different with independent candidates. The independent candidates have a new election symbol. As a result, it can create confusion among the voters. And, this can also curtail their votes.",political
10 independent candidates stealing the limelight during Nepal local elections,"You have already noticed that the election fever has already gripped the nation as the  date of local elections  is coming closer. After  filing their candidacies , the candidates and their supporters are going door to door to woo voters. Moreover, the local elections this time are expected to get more interesting as there are some interesting characters as  independent candidates .  Some of the independent candidates are earning so much hype and they have become the talk of the town all across the country. Today, we have come up with a list of 10 key independent candidates for the local elections as they have stolen the limelight across Nepal.    Rapper and structural engineer  Balen Shah , popularly known by his first name, has filed a nomination for the  mayor of  Kathmandu  metropolitan city.

Paudel is also the spearheader of the  Ateri  campaign, a social campaign concerned with leadership.  He is the author of Paitala, a novel, and has translated John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men into the Nepali language and published it as Musa Manush.  Narsingh Byanjakar  is probably one of the oldest independent candidates in the upcoming local elections. The 89-year-old has filed a nomination for the post of ward chair of Lalitpur metropolitan city-10.   Prakash Bhattarai  has filed a nomination for the position of mayor of  Sundarharaicha municipality in the Morang district. Bhattarai holds a PhD in peace and conflict from Otago University, New Zealand. He has been working in the field of democracy, good governance and social justice for the last 20 years.  Sumit Kharel has registered his candidacy for the mayor of Budhanilkantha municipality. Kharel worked at the secretariat of the outgoing Budhanilakantha mayor for four years before deciding to run for the top position. The 32-year-old independent candidate is also a Teach for Nepal alumni.   Prem Bahadur Bohora has filed his nominations for the Thulo Bheri municipality mayor in Dolpa.  Bohora is popular among the youth in his district, and for a long time, he has been running youth awareness and anti-corruption campaigns. Likewise, he is also the author of Kogle, a book that tells the story of Dolpa’s youth.    Maya Gurung has filed a nomination for the post of chairperson of Panchpokhari Thangpal rural municipality in Sindhupalchok.  She has submitted Mt Everest and all the highest peaks of seven continents.

7 positions that you need to vote for in local elections,"On May 13, 2022, Nepal is holding its next local elections in six metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolitan cities, 276 municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities. It will be the second municipal elections to be held since the  new constitution  was promulgated.  In the local elections, 35,221 representatives will be elected in 753 local units will be elected. But, that is a lot of numbers, so one might be confused about whom to vote for and how to vote.  But, do not get confused because as an individual, you have to vote for just seven positions in your local unit only.  So, here are the seven positions you need to vote for in the  local elections  in 2022.  In the first column of your ballot paper, you will vote for your next mayor or chairperson. Though it is referred to as two positions, you are voting for the same position. Where the mayor is in charge of municipalities, sub-metropolitan cities and metropolitan cities, the chairperson is the leading figure in the rural municipalities. So, based on where you live, you are either voting for your mayor or your chairperson.  In the first column for the mayor, you will find election symbols of all the candidates, either from political parties or independent ones.  The mayor or chairperson is the key figure in all strategic planning as well as in establishing strong governance in their respective local units. It is a gender-neutral role, but, in reality, there is more male presence. Since they are the highest-ranking individual, it is critical to vote for a solid candidate during the local elections. If that authority is not exercised properly, it can be abused, which might jeopardise the municipality’s future. So this is the most important vote you will cast during the local elections. Next, in the second column of your ballot paper, you will vote for your next deputy mayor or vice-chairperson of your local government. Much like explained before, these two words refer to the same position. The deputy mayor is for municipalities, sub-metropolitan cities and metropolitan cities whereas the vice-chairperson is for rural municipalities. Again, based on where you live, you are either voting for your deputy mayor or your vice-chairperson.  Similarly, in the second column too, you will find electoral symbols of all the candidates, either from political parties or independent ones.  The deputy mayor or vice-chairperson is the key figure to guide the mayor or chairperson in all their endeavours. The election rule has it that any party fielding its candidates for both the mayor and deputy mayor (or chairperson or vice-chairperson) has to make its two candidates representing different gender groups. As a result, the local units saw more female presence in the deputy leadership positions in the 2017 local elections. In the absence of the mayor or the chairperson, the deputy fills in the void and takes over the responsibilities. In carrying out their duties, they maintain the smooth operation of their local unit. So, you need to remember to vote for a deserving candidate who will aid in the development of your specific area. In the third column of the ballot paper during the local elections, you will vote for your ward chairperson. There, you will find electoral symbols of all the candidates, either from political parties or independent ones. There are  6,743 wards across 753 local units and you will be voting for a candidate who will lead your ward for the next five years. Elected ward chairpersons  are in charge of ensuring that their local units are well organised and functioning well as per the constitution and that problems of local units are dealt with in an orderly and efficient way. The chairperson must maximise the contributions of all committee members while also establishing and guiding the team. As a result, if suitable leaders are not elected, such responsibilities may not be carried out correctly. In the next step, you need to vote for four ward members. These four ward members represent three different groups.  In the fourth column of the local elections’ ballot paper, you will vote for a female ward member whereas, in the fifth column, you will vote for a female ward member from a Dalit community.  In the last section, under the sixth and seventh columns, you will have to vote for two other ward members representing the open category.  It means two of these four members must be women, with one of those women belonging to the  Dalit community  whereas the remaining two members can be men or women.  The four members are responsible for supervising and documenting developments in their ward.  When voting in the local elections, you will be given a ballot paper. After getting it, you will enter the polling booth where you will find a swastika stamp to cast your vote. And, that is all that you require.  In the local elections, you will be voting for seven different positions, so you will have to put a stamp on seven different columns. You need a stamp on the election symbol of the candidate you want to vote for.  Voters must pick their representatives wisely and vote on the proper symbols since the future of their ward is at stake. Remember to stamp within the box, not touching the edges. If this is the case, the vote will be invalid. You also have to remember that the stamp should not be smudged or unclear to read. You can find this information in this video published by the  Election Commission  too.",political
Local elections: Commission completes printing ballot papers for 72 districts,"Kathmandu, April 28 The  Election Commission  says it has completed printing ballot papers for 72 districts for the May 13 local elections. The commission says it has completed printing 17.7 million ballot papers as of Thursday.  It means the papers are yet to be printed for the remaining five districts. Meanwhile, the commission says it has registered 153,002  nominations of candidates  for the local elections across the country. However, this shall not be considered the final count because of three reasons. Firstly, the commission is yet to receive reports from some local units. Secondly, the commission might cancel some candidates’ nominations if they are found to be ineligible based on the complaints filed against them. Thirdly, the candidates might withdraw the nominations on the allocated date (Friday). The commission will publish the final list of candidates on Friday evening as per the  announced calendar .",political
Nepal local elections: Here are basic dos and don’ts for every voter,"In Nepal, the local elections are going to be held on  May 13  (Baisakh 30) in six metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolitan cities, 276 municipalities, and 460 rural municipalities. As a responsible citizen of a country, you must be involved in the voting system held nationally to choose the right candidate.  To maintain the dignity of such valuable democratic institutions, it is essential to understand the code of conduct and the voting procedure. In this article, we will discuss the various dos and don’ts while participating in the activity of voting. The age of eligibility for voting in Nepal is 18 years. When you reach the age, you will need to register your name in the voters’ list to get the voter’s identity card. With a copy of your citizenship and your photo, you can register yourself at the District Election Office or District Administration Office. But, this does not happen all the time. The  Election Commission  allocates a certain period for voter registration. When a new election is announced, the registration gets closed. It means you cannot register yourself as a voter today.  While taking part in the local elections in Nepal, you will need some documents to show your identity as a voter.  A code of conduct refers to all the set of rules and regulations that participants in the election procedure–including the government, political parties, candidates, and citizens who are voting for them. So, here are the dos and don’ts of the code of conduct that needs to be fulfilled by you (as a citizen): You can read all the codes of conduct of all the participants in the election process including the government, candidates, political parties, etc. in the  Election Code of Conduct . On violating the election code of conduct, action and punishment shall be taken in accordance with the Election Commission Act (2007). Avoid invalidating your vote Voting is your right, and every vote is equally valuable. As the local elections are coming up, there are a few things to understand. The Election Commission upholds certain criteria when it comes to counting the votes. So, if you want your vote to count, do make sure that you follow these guidelines and ensure that your vote is not nullified:",political

It has been learned that Jhakri has already submitted her response, and the commission is studying it. Whereas the  code of conduct  bars public office holders from going abroad without getting it approved by the commission, Minister Jhakri recently went abroad without informing the commission, according to a commission source. Earlier, the commission had received a complaint against the minister. If the commission finds the clarification unconvincing, Minister Ram Kumari Jhakri will be quizzed again, according to the commission.",political
Election participation row virtually splits Biplav’s Maoist party,"Kathmandu, April 27 Growing differences over whether to participate in the upcoming  local elections  have virtually split the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’. On Wednesday, the top leader of the party removed two key leaders in his group–Dharmendra Bastola and Hemanta Prakash Oli–who were against Biplav’s proposal of participating in the polls. The Biplav-led party is not officially registered at the  Election Commission . However, its local leaders have filed their candidacies independently in a few districts including Rolpa. Biplav apparently supports them. Reportedly, the top leader had proposed participating in the elections during the party meeting earlier, which could not get endorsed due to the objection of Bastola and Oli among others.  In his Wednesday statement, Biplav has accused Bastola and Oli of promoting various activities in the party that would eventually lead to a split.",political
Ward chairs in Nepal’s local governments are overworked. It’s about time they got more powers too,"Ever since Shobha Sapkota became the ward chair of Kathmandu metropolitan city’s ward 14, her phone did not stop ringing. There were times when her phone started to ring in the middle of the night. Not wanting to entertain them, she did not answer during odd hours.  But, one day, a few people gathered around her house at night demanding that the ward chair do something about a dog that barked all night. She addressed the complaint and asked the community police to talk to the dog owner. Ward chairs around the country are busy doing everything. From solving issues like the one mentioned above to dealing with domestic disputes, they also need to do many things that are not mentioned in the law or the constitution. People come to them with complaints regarding water, roads, waste and money. They try and solve almost all of them, but due to a lack of resources and proper rights, they have not been able to work to their full potential. As the  local election date is approaching closer , stakeholders demand the government review their rights and responsibilities. There are 6,743 ward chairs working in 753 local governments across the country. All of them have to maintain good relationships with the locals and work with them for the betterment of society. These people are the ones that connect the people to the upper level of the government too. But despite this, there is hardly any discourse taking place about what the roles and responsibilities of a ward chair actually are. “A ward chair mostly works under a lot of uncertainty,” says Pavitra Subba, who worked as a member of the  Local Level Restructuring Commission . “They act as a bridge between the people and the top level, but because their roles aren’t defined well, they can’t work as effectively as they can.” Since ward chairs work at the lowermost level of the government, they are a major component of the democratic process. But, their roles are limited and that is quite pointless, argue experts. “We should have decentralised the rights that the mayor has and given more rights to the ward chairs. That would have been more effective and helped in the development process,” says Shyam Kumar Bhurtel, a local governance expert.  He says that if a ward does well, that benefits the community in different ways. “This in turn strengthens the democratic process because they are the government of the people they need to be given more power,” he adds. Former secretary Mukti Rijal says the work of wards is one of the reasons federalism has thrived in Nepal.  “A lack of people’s participation means the system lacks the rule of law,” says Rijal. “But, thanks to the work by ward chairs, people haven’t had to face issues.” A former secretary at the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, Reshmi Raj Pandey, calls the local government the ultimate formal institution of democracy.  “If this is strong, the country will become stronger because it will do its best to manage the neighbourhoods, which will help develop the country,” says Pandey.  Hence, a committee led by then secretary Tirtha Man Shakya in 2003 had suggested the government connect the local governments with the community. The committee, which Pandey was also a part of, had told the government that it needed to focus on the grassroots and had suggested that all wards had a neighbourhood committee. Leaders back then were not interested in his suggestion, but he believes the plan is still applicable now. “We told them the governance would be easy if they followed this model where the local government would be the strongest government. It can still be followed,” he says. The  Local Government Operation Act, 2017,  has followed what Shakya and Pandey suggested in 2003. But, it has not been followed to date. There are few places where a neighbourhood development committee has been formed, but as not all wards have pushed this, its effectiveness is still not as much as Pandey and Shakya had hoped for. For the first decade since Nepal became a republic, the local government did not have much power. It was only after the country adopted federalism in 2017 that things started to change. A lot of village development committees were changed into wards and the responsibilities carried out by the VDC chairs were given to the ward chairs. Experts even argue their responsibilities have increased, but their power has not. According to Bhurtel, ward chairs have three responsibilities. First, they act as a local executive and disseminate information to the government. Second, they also act as a member of the parliament and are active in the local assembly and draft laws and policies. Third, they do all the work a ward chair should do and provide services and conduct development works. “The ward chairs have also been helping out to make community schools better. We’ve seen them help and change roofs of schools that would leak water during the monsoon. They play a major role in community development,” says Gopi Khanal, an undersecretary at the  Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration . They also provide recommendation and verification services to citizens. This might not look like a tough task, but there are many government offices that do not work without the recommendation of the ward. For a person to make a citizenship certificate or build a house, they need documents from the ward office. They also have data on people who are born and who die in the ward. These are directly related to people’s fundamental rights. “When streetlights of a neighbourhood in Kathmandu weren’t working, a ward member went to the poles and change the bulbs himself. He didn’t need to do it, but he still did because this type of effort is remembered by the people,” says Bhurtel. “If you look at it, most ward chairs have done more than they get from the state. They are key in the development of the country,” says Pandey. “I personally feel the local governments are a success story. They do more than the central or the provincial government. They make the community more active and involve them in various activities which helps the country.” Mukti Rijal, who also works as a senior research fellow at the  Policy Research Institute , says ward chairs are doing more than what is asked of them by the constitution.  “They have to do everything, yet they aren’t given the resources to do them better,” says Rijal. The main issue they face is a financial crisis. For every development work they want to do, they have to go to their respective municipal offices. They have to do this even during emergencies. Take what happened in the Thuladurlung village in Lalitpur for example. The village is 64 kilometres away from Satdobato. The village, till 2014, did not even have roads.  On July 21, 2017, a landslide in the village killed a six-year-old girl. Ward chair Ram Krishna Acharya immediately reached the incident site to take stock. Due to financial reasons, the parents could not even take the body for postmortem. “I wanted to help. But, I don’t have the authority to spend a penny without permission,” says Acharya. “What’s the use when we can’t help people when they need immediate help? What’s the use of this power?” He says he gave the father of the victim Rs 5,000 from his own pocket. While returning home, he asked himself if becoming a ward chair was a mistake. Other ward chairs face a similar issue. They do not even have the rights secretaries at village development committees once had. Bhurtel says that decentralisation has not happened in the local governments.  “Ward chairs haven’t been able to develop their offices into budget units. Some ward chairs asked the centre to make things easier for them, but their efforts went in vain,” says Bhurtel. He says that they should be given the freedom to build teams and work toward making a change. But currently, almost everyone is dependent on the mayor. “We need to decentralise the power if we want real change,” he adds. Another official working at the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration says ward chairs are busy with minor administrative work, due to which they have not been able to focus on other work. “Many ward chairs now think they should limit themselves to the responsibilities of a ward chair. They don’t want to do more and just focus on getting budget for themselves,” says the official. The Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration has conducted research and analysis on the working of local governments, but it has not done so at the ward level.

"Fact check: Mahesh Acharya had resigned as defence minister, not finance minister, after the NRB governor’s reinstatement","On April 7, 2022, the government  suspended Nepal Rastra Bank Governor  Maha Prasad Adhikari. Various news reports claimed that the action against the governor was the result of a  tussle  between him and Finance Minister Janardan Sharma. On April 17, Adhikari  moved the Supreme Court  against the government decision. Two days later, on April 19, the apex  court issued an interim order  reinstating Adhikari. After the governor’s reinstatement, media reports said the finance minister was under moral pressure to resign. Media reports claimed, in a similar case, over two decades ago, “the then finance minister Mahesh Acharya” had resigned on March 29, 2001, after the then governor, Tilak Rawal, was reinstated by the Supreme Court. Nepali daily Kantipur, English-language daily  The Kathmandu Post , and Nepali news website  Setopati  published news reports claiming that Mahesh Acharya had resigned as the finance minister after the court reinstated the then Governor Rawal. Also, Nepali Congress spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma in a  tweet  made a similar claim. South Asia Check fact-checked this claim with the help of archival materials including newspaper reports of that time. — The then Governor Rawal was sacked by the government on August 28, 2000. Within a few days, on September 6, Rawal challenged the decision at the Supreme Court. Then, on March 28, 2001, the court overturned the government decision and reinstated Rawal for his remaining term.  At the time of Rawal’s sacking, Acharya was finance minister in the Girija Prasad Koirala-led government. Acharya was also assigned the defence portfolio by the government on October 2, 2000, and he held both portfolios until February 7, 2001. On February 8, 2001, Kantipur reported that Koirala reshuffled his cabinet on February 7. Following the reshuffle, Ram Sharan Mahat was appointed finance minister on February 12 while Acharya was made defence minister. “Observers have viewed the removal of Mahesh Acharya from key responsibility of finance ministry and assignment as defence minister as meaningful since he is regarded as extremely close to the prime minister and also enjoyed the goodwill of donor agencies,” the Kantipur report of February 8, 2001, said. Then on March 28, 2001, the Supreme Court reinstated Governor Rawal stating that his sacking was against the law. After the court verdict, Acharya resigned as defence minister on March 29. In a report published on March 30, 2001 (see newspaper clip above), Kantipur said Acharya resigned as the defence minister on moral grounds after Governor Rawal was reinstated by the Supreme Court. Likewise, India’s ZEE News published a report on March 29, 2001, under the headline:  Nepal’s defence minister resigns .  Hence, the claim that Acharya resigned as finance minister after Rawal’s reinstatement is false. He had resigned as defence minister. first appeared",political
Mayor of Kathmandu: 12 qualities you need to look for before voting,"Voting for a mayor is more important than people think; it is more important when it comes to voting for the mayor of Kathmandu as it is the country’s capital.  Political experts say voting for a mayor is even more important than voting for a president because a good mayor can do a lot to change the face of a city. Take  what Sunil Prajapati has done in Bhaktapur  and Dilip Khand has done in Waling. Through good leadership and determination, these people have changed the way people see the city contrary to what Bidya Sundar Shakya, the outgoing  mayor of Kathmandu, has done . So what constitutes a good mayor of Kathmandu? What qualities does a person need to have to become a good mayor? Today, we discuss a few qualities that you should consider before you vote for your mayor. The most important thing before voting for a mayor of Kathmandu is to know his or her vision. What have they planned for the city? Is the plan practical? The promise of a monorail in Kathmandu is great, but you all have seen how impractical that vision was. It is important for the citizens to know who the mayor is. Why? Having a personal connection with the people is proof that the mayor cares about the people. If he/she does not put in the effort, it is highly likely that he/she will not listen to anyone once in power. This is another trait that needs to be taken into consideration while voting for the mayor of Kathmandu. A mayor is someone who represents the city and he/she needs to have a strong personality whereby he/she can lead by example without being intimidated by anyone. Voters should also consider if the candidate is moral. This year, Keshav Sthapit is contesting for the mayor of Kathmandu. But, you also know  Sthapit has been accused  by multiple women of sexually harassing them. He may work for the betterment of the city, but a voter should not vote for anyone who does not respect women or other human beings. As mayors directly with bureaucrats and other people, the mayor of Kathmandu needs to understand the value of building relationships with each other. If he/she listens to people, that is a good start because listening can go a long way to building a better community.  This has been a major issue with many mayors in Nepal. They take credit for a lot of things that go right. But, when it comes to things that did not go right, they were quick to put the blame on someone else. So, accountability is a major criterion that needs to be taken into consideration before voting for your mayor of Kathmandu this time.  Modern problems need modern solutions. So, the mayor of Kathmandu must also be a critical thinker who can come up with ways to tackle issues as they come but do so in a manner which is best for the city.  This is key because if they do not listen, that person is not a good candidate. Being a leader means that the person needs to listen. They should be able to understand the concerns, ideas, and perspectives of different people and address them. Communication is key and if they are not willing to communicate, don’t vote for them for the mayor of Kathmandu. Inclusion is crucial because you cannot do everything on your own. So, if a candidate is willing to work with people from all walks of life and economic backgrounds, pick them to lead you. In a country that is plagued by corruption, it is important that the mayoral candidate is transparent when it comes to money. If you cannot be transparent, there is no way you are fit to be the mayor of Kathmandu. Most candidates get to become a mayor thanks to their affiliation with a party and there are rumours that when they become mayors, they amass loads of money for the party for the coming election. If true, this needs to stop.  Administrative work in Nepal is tiresome. And, that is something that these candidates should focus on. Promises of infrastructure development are great, but these do not help the people as much as they think. Simplifying the internal administrative process would go a long way and create actual change in the community. Leaving behind a legacy should not be the first thing on their agenda, but it should be on the back of their mind because if they do, they will work with determination. Leaving a positive legacy will do wonders in the long run as the person who succeeds them will have to work with the same vigour as their predecessor, which is great for the city.",political

Maoist Centre to contest local elections without any manifesto at the central level,"Kathmandu, April 25 The  CPN-Maoist Centre , a member of the central ruling coalition, says it will not prepare any manifesto for the upcoming  local elections . Whereas all major parties have already launched their election manifestoes, the Maoist party says it has not thought of drafting the manifesto. Maoist Centre leader Haribol Gajurel says the local committee, however, can prepare their manifestoes considering the local context.  Another leader Barsha Man Pun says the party has decided not to issue any manifesto as it is not appropriate for the centre to issue manifestoes for local elections under the federal constitution. “With the manifestoes at the centre, we don’t interfere. Whoever will implement the programmes, whoever will work with the people, they have to prepare the manifestoes as they are accountable to the public.” The party’s central office secretary Shreeram Dhakal says the party has issued an appeal to its leaders and cadres across the country about the local elections, and the local units will make and issue their manifestoes based on that appeal. Although the party has not issued the manifesto per se, its appeal has addressed crucial policy concerns that the party will raise during the local elections, according to the party leaders.",political

In the manifesto, the party, in addition to what it promises to do at the local level, has also mentioned what it does not want to do.

"UML’s pick of Keshav Sthapit, a #MeToo accused, for Kathmandu mayor raises moral questions","The CPN-UML on Saturday announced Keshav Sthapit and  Sunita Dangol  as its candidates for the positions of mayor and deputy mayor of Kathmandu metropolitan city for the upcoming local elections.  There was a lot of encouragement for Dangol as the UML was giving a woman below 30 a chance to contest in the elections on behalf of the party. However, people were enraged that Keshav Sthapit, who was accused by multiple people of sexually harassing them, has been given a ticket to contest the polls. While activists are angry with the UML, vocal women inside the party have kept mum over the issue, further frustrating the activists and raising serious moral questions. “This shows how poor Nepal’s justice system is. Even though a person has been accused of sexual harassment, he’s being protected by the party and given a ticket to become a mayor,” says human rights activist Mohna Ansari. The accusation against Keshav Sthapit first came up in 2018 when Ujjwala Maharjan, a former journalist, on  Facebook accused him of sexually harassing her in 2012 . In an interview with The Kathmandu Post, Maharjan said Sthapit continuously texted her asking her to meet him when he was the head of the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority. “He called me at night, and it didn’t just happen once,” Maharjan said to the Post in 2018. “For at least four or five nights, he kept calling. I just didn’t want to deal with him. I just ignored him.” She was not the only one. A former staffer of the Kathmandu metropolitan city,  Rashmila Prajapati, also accused Sthapit  of making her uncomfortable. She had written that Sthapit fired her after she rejected his repeated advances masked as an offer for a promotion. She said Sthapit made regular efforts to take her out, telling her he wanted to spend quality time with her. All of these accusations were  denied by Sthapit in 2018  when he was the Physical Infrastructure Minister for Bagmati province. The voices got silent after Keshav  Sthapit was fired  by Chief Minister Dormani Paudel although not because of the #MeToo charge. But, Keshav Sthapit is coming to the surface again because several people on social media are questioning the morality of the CPN-UML for allowing a suspected sexual offender to vie for the key position.  Ansari says, “Yet again, we are seeing a person accused of a crime being allowed to contest an election and that I feel is personally unfortunate for us.” She says that this happens repeatedly because the Election Commission has not formed a basic human rights principle about who can and cannot contest the elections. She says this will, in the long run, also set a bad precedent as more people like Sthapit who have been accused of a crime will come out. “History will repeat itself,” she says. Sthapit, however, says he does not care about such charges. After filing his candidacy for the mayoral position on Monday, Sthapit very lightly told the press, “If there was not an issue with me, what’s the essence of Keshav Sthapit? Keshav Sthapit cannot be free of controversy, he has to be disputed about.”   Binda Pandey, a member of UML’s standing committee, who is vocal about women’s rights in politics, says Keshav Sthapit was recommended by the party’s district committee and endorsed by the secretariat. “I am not part of the committee that decided to give his name. It was done by the secretariat,” says Pandey. When asked what she personally felt, she did not comment. But, another member of the UML says the decision to recommend Keshav Sthapit was purely political. “We want to give seats to people who can win us the election and we feel Keshav can do that. He’s showed us he can do it before and we believe he can do it now,” says the member without addressing the sexual harassment allegations against Sthapit.  Sunita Dangol, who would be Sthapit’s deputy if both win the polls, says she is against all forms of violence and she will not compromise it. That said, she does add that since these allegations have not been proven, and that she has not spoken to the survivors, she has nothing to say about it.  “I have time and again stated that I am against all forms of violence and have even stated that I want to form a women’s cell to stop these incidents from happening,” she says. “But, dragging me into this issue right now is uncalled for.” She says that this issue should be brought forward every day not just before the elections. “It’s like people only remember this when the election is around or when people assume some sort of position. We need to stop with the propaganda and dive deep into the issue,” she says.",political
"In Lingden’s Jhapa, UML and Nepali Congress partner against RPP","Biratnagar, April 24 Perhaps in one of the unique examples in Nepal’s history, two archrivals–CPN-UML and Nepali Congress–have partnered for the upcoming local elections, in the Jhapa district of eastern Nepal.

Narainapur in Banke: A successful case of Nepal’s federal constitution changing people’s lives,"A few years ago, the village of Narainapur in Banke, was as rural as any other village in the country. The road to the village was dreadful. Consumable goods had to be carried from Nepalgunj and some shops in the village did not even accept Nepali currencies.  Even though the village was in Nepal, it had a lot of Indian influence. The remains of that are still quite evident in the area. But as Nepal drafted  the constitution in 2015  and adopted federalism in 2017, the village of Narainapur has had a makeover. The village that had nothing has a bank and that has helped the people of the village a lot.  “With the establishment of Sunrise Bank, we don’t have to travel for hours for money. People who go for foreign employment directly send the money to the bank. This has helped us a lot,” says Umesh Bista, a resident of Narainapur, recalling how the village was completely reliant on India a decade ago. Basic items like rice, flour, salt and oil had to be brought from India. Why? Because getting to Nepalgunj was difficult. There was no road as the villagers had to walk for three days to get to the district headquarters. It was after the 2017 elections that the locals demanded their local representatives to build a road joining Nepalgunj and Narainapur. The  rural municipality  obliged and paved a road by building nearly a dozen bridges. Today, buses run on that road regularly. “Things have improved over the past two years. All of our demands haven’t been met, but the local representatives have worked to make this rural municipality better,” says Bista. Before the road was built, people only went to Nepalgunj for administrative work or banking. For everything else, they went to India.  But, since the 2017 elections, things changed. They got roads, electricity and drinking water. With that, people started to come and set up shops around the rural municipalities. A brick kiln was also set up. The rural municipality has also started researching the possibility of starting an agriculture industry in the area to create more employment opportunities. There are five brick kilns in Narainapur. Each kiln gives employment to around 200 people, says Ahmed Mukeri, the rural municipality employment coordinator. But, only half of these are Nepali. “We’re asking them to hire more Nepalis from Narainapur so that we can be sustainable,” says Mukeri. He says since the Covid pandemic, a lot of people have come to his office looking for work, and he hopes that his office and the rural municipality can provide them with jobs. On  April 4 last year , 16 families lost their houses to fire. As soon as news of the fire broke, the rural municipality sent its fire engine to control it. But, since the roofs were thatched, the fire engine could do very little to save them. To help them, the rural municipality has handed out relief materials, food and tents. Incidents like these are common in the area and to stop them from happening, the local government has started a campaign to replace the thatched roofs with zinc sheets. It also distributed gas stoves to 1,000 families so that firewood would not cause more incidents like these in the area. But, the risk of fire gutting houses is still prevalent. Locals agree that life has been easy thanks to the local government that helps regularly. If there had been a fire three years ago, a team from Nepalgunj would only have arrived three days after the incident. Aid would come a week later. But, due to the presence of the local government, they have not had to starve or sleep roofless. A few years ago, girls from Narainapur rarely went to school. But, with time, more and more people have started to send their daughters to school. Masud Ahmed Sah, ward chair of Nairanapur 2, says girls make up 40 per cent of the total students in his ward. “There was a time when the number of girls in our schools was zero. This change we’ve seen is encouraging,” says Sah, claiming only 5 per cent of children from the rural municipality do not go to school today. To encourage girls to go to school, the rural municipality has handed out free cycles to all schoolgirls. A free bus service has also been launched by the rural municipality to encourage people to send their children to go to school. Until 2018, the rural municipality only had schooling to the 10th grade. But now, Narainapur also has a high school where grown-ups have enrolled. According to Lachhuram Kumar, a teacher, since federalism, the people of Narainapur have been more aware of things happening around them. They have realised their rights, he says. “The state of schools was poor, but now, that is changing. Parents want their children to go to school,” says Kumar, adding there are 21 schools and 27 madrasas in Narainapur rural municipality. He says people are also sending their children to schools in Nepalgunj and India. “But, there are people who still want them to stay at home and help out and not go to school. But, this number is few and far between,” says Kumar. Lalit Chandra Prajapati of Narainapur-4 says a lot still needs to improve including the quality of teachers in the area. He says he is contesting in the local elections this time, and if he wins, he will improve the quality of teachers in the schools in his ward. “When you don’t have an education, you become a slave in this country. I don’t want children from the coming generation to be slaves. I will improve the state of schools in the area,” says Parajapti  Before 2017, Narainapur did not have leaders. All they had were voters. But since the local level has reached Narainapur, people have realised how good leadership can create change in a place. Like Prajapati, there are women in Narainapur who are thinking about contesting in the local elections this year. Prajapati is promising he will manage more teachers, and toilets in every household and provide clean drinking water to all.  “Change needs to start from the local level. If I get help from political parties, great! If not, I’ll contest as an independent candidate,” says Prajapati. Puja Baniya is also thinking about contesting as a ward member. But, she has not been able to share this with her husband as she fears they might not take it well. “I’ll ask them and if they agree, I’ll give in my name,” says Baniya. There is a general feeling among the people of Narainapur that they can still do better. “We’ve seen a hospital, schools and roads being built. But there is a lot more we can do,” says Baniya. The citizens of Narainapur are looking for ways to develop the area too. Locals actively take part in discourses to see how they can change their locality. They have collected signatures of locals to push the rural municipality to establish an industry, says local Umesh Bista. “It’s cheaper to buy than to produce. Why? Because we haven’t used technology and don’t have a commercial market,” says Bista. The locals hope their demands can be put forward in the parliament as they hope that it will bring in more interest and development in the area. Narainapur is located on the border area. During the first wave of Covid, the rural municipality had  become the epicentre . Hundreds of people started to return to the village after losing jobs in India and other parts of Nepal. With them, they also brought the virus which spread rapidly. But, the place did not have the infrastructure to cope with the virus. The local government tried its best. It built temporary isolation centres and used schools to treat patients. “Sure, it did create problems, but I think we also did a lot of development work in the area,” says Laxmi Kanta Mishra, the disaster management chief of the rural municipality. Mishra says the pandemic paved the way for developing infrastructures in the area. He says the local government even brought a generator to run these isolation centres in the mid of summer. Since using a generator was not practical, the local representatives then were pressurised to bring electricity to the area.  But, to take the electricity, they needed roads too. Wards 2, 3 and 4 did not have roads and since they needed electricity, roads were built. “Scarcity helped in development. Everyone from the area helped. It was a joint effort to combat Covid and develop the area,” says Mishra.",political

"Warned by MCC hullabaloo in Nepal, China clarifies BRI isn’t a geopolitical strategy","Kathmandu, April 21 It appears China has been warned by the  prolonged hullabaloo  created over the  acceptance  of the US government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) grant in Nepal as it has started to clarify that its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not a geopolitical strategy. It is noted that the voices against the Chinese President Xi Jinping’s flagship project in Nepal are not as loud as they are against the US government’s grant deal that many believe is a part of its Indo Pacific Strategy. But, without being questioned, the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal,  Hou Yanqi , told the media in her briefing on Thursday morning that the Chinese initiative was not a geopolitical strategy, suggesting she was conscious of potential criticisms. “I would like to point out that BRI has never been a “geopolitical strategy”, but a road of development that helps countries along the road, especially developing countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and promote common development and prosperity,” Hou said, “The projects under BRI serve to promote mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries and improve people’s livelihood and well-being.”  She added that when selecting and implementing specific projects, both governments and enterprises would be required to follow the principles of openness, transparency and friendly consultation with each other. The diplomat blamed the Covid pandemic for a lack of progress in implementing the plans agreed to be held under the BRI, assuring stakeholders they would gain momentum in the future.  She stated taking the BRI projects ahead was also one of the major points on agenda during the recent  visit of Chinese Foreign Minister  Wang Yi.",political

Prithvi Bahadur Shah and finance minister-NRB governor tussle: Your FAQs answered,"Until last month, Prithvi Bahadur Shah was no one for the public. But, by now, he holds the paramount attention among the people interested in Nepal’s political and economic affairs.  As people have connected the  suspension  and  failed ouster  of Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari with his name, everyone is curious about who he is, and what the controversy is all about.  If you have not been following the recent developments, just do not worry. We have got you covered with this brief explainer.  A permanent resident of Darna-8 of Achham, Prithvi Bahadur Shah is a businessperson. For the past 16 years, he has been operating various businesses in the export/ import, real estate and cooperative sectors. A few of his businesses include Holi-Day & Travels, and Pay Safe Remittance. According to a report prepared by the Financial Information Unit ( FIU ) of Nepal Rastra Bank, Prithvi Bahadur Shah appears to have remitted Rs 90 million that he earned from fraud, crime, revenue leakage and criminal profits abroad via online means. During the investigation, it was reportedly revealed that he has opened at least half a dozen companies and tried to transfer money from the United States by using the same details in all. The companies he is involved in are World Travels and Investment Pvt Ltd, World First Holiday Pvt Ltd, World Wide Remit Pvt Ltd, World Export and Import Pvt Ltd, and Times Today Peace Holiday Environment Pvt.  On December 22, 2020, it was first said that Shah’s World Travels and Investment Pvt Ltd brought in USD 35,900 in Nepal. However, the sender’s name (Katherine Greene) was revealed later, creating suspicions over the transaction. The central bank has found out of the Rs 400 million that Shah brought into Nepal, Rs 90 million was directly generated from crime. On March 22, 2021, using online means, he brought the money from Standard Chartered Bank of New York as a capital for investment here. Following the immediate intervention of the NRB, the amount was frozen. Meanwhile, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the United States also sent a request to the national bank to return all the money, saying it was earned through criminal activities. They mentioned that Shah and his associates have transferred around Rs 90 million in 17 transactions from criminal activities.   In response, the NRB in an internal statement said that it had withheld funds “based on information obtained through a highly confidential international information network” from FinCEN.  It was also revealed that Shah was accused of the same and was arrested four years ago for trading in Indian rupees. Shah, however, maintained that he legitimately brought money while speaking at a press conference.  But, now, Shah reportedly submitted an application to the finance minister, requesting him to help him obtain back the money, sparking a fresh controversy.  The details of Prithvi Bahadur Shah’s connection with Finance Minister Janardan Sharma and (a lack of it with) Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari are not known yet. However, the  media have accused Finance Minister Sharma  of trying to protect Shah from facing action for his alleged involvement in illegitimate transactions, hinting Prithvi Bahadur Shah has some connections with him. In the same manner, NRB Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari is said to have taken action against Shah by freezing his accounts. According to several reports, the government was suspended as the finance minister did not want Adhikari to freeze the accounts. Minister Sharma, however, says he does not personally know Prithvi Bahadur Shah. He says he just wanted to take stock of the issue after  Shah’s emotional appeal . After his money was withheld, Prithvi Bahadur Shah wrote a letter to Finance Minister Janardan Sharma on March 25, 2022, requesting him to release the money. In response, Sharma directed the secretary to show cause for account freezing and unfreeze it at the earliest. Then, Secretary Madhu Marasini had written to the NRB as per the minister’s instruction. When the controversy escalated, the government suspended Adhikari, halting the investigation process at the NRB.  In the meantime, the Nepal Police Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also questioned the source of Shah’s assets, suspecting his involvement in criminal activities including revenue fraud, asset laundering, fraud and other activities.  On the other hand, Shah had also reached out to the Supreme Court demanding the central bank halt the ongoing investigation. A bench of justices Bishawambhar Prasads Shrestha and Kumar Chudal, however, did not give any order in his favour. Moreover, the court did not validate the suspension of NRB Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari and issued an interim order to let him continue working.  If posts and comments on social media are anything to go by, the public apparently wants the central bank to continue the investigation against Prithvi Bahadur Shah and take action. Similarly, there are demands rife for the finance minister’s resignation.  Given the public support, it is highly likely that the NRB and the police continue the investigation against Shah. However, it is not sure yet if he will get the deserving punishment as he has already proven his connections with high-rank politicians.",political
