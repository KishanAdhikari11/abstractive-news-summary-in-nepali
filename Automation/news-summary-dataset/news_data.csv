RPP faces internal strife as Lingden’s leadership comes under fire,"KATHMANDU: Internal division is brewing within the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) as Rajendra Lingden’s leadership comes under intense scrutiny. Concerns have arisen over Lingden’s ability to lead effectively, especially following the party’s disappointing performance in the recent local by-elections. There are accusations that he has been unwilling to collaborate with like-minded parties, which has contributed to growing discontent within the RPP. The party failed to retain deposits for its candidates, even in Lingden’s home district, with a particularly poor result in Kanakai Municipality-6 of Jhapa, where the party’s candidate received only 26 votes. A dissatisfied party member questioned how the party could progress under Lingden’s leadership, especially given the dismal results in his own district. The RPP has also seen a decline in support from urban voters, with candidates receiving low vote counts in Kirtipur and Kathmandu. Furthermore, Lingden is said to have hindered efforts to unite with Kamal Thapa-led RPP Nepal and other pro-monarchy groups, frustrating senior leaders like Pashupati Shamsher Rana, who had advocated for broader unification to strengthen the party. As the party’s support base continues to shrink, Lingden’s refusal to pursue alliances has exacerbated the situation. The upcoming Central Committee meeting, scheduled for January 24-25, is expected to see intense discussions, with some party leaders potentially proposing leadership changes. Even former King Gyanendra Shah has expressed disillusionment with Lingden’s leadership, with sources close to the former monarch indicating regret over his support of Lingden, who has failed to lead the party toward meaningful progress."

Maoist Center claims govt’s actions will lead to its downfall,"KATHMANDU: The Maoist Centre, the main opposition party, has stated that the current government under Prime Minister KP Oli will ultimately collapse due to its own failings. Agni Prasad Sapkota, the party’s Vice Chair and Spokesperson, said this following a meeting of party leaders at the residence of Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” in Khumaltar on Monday. Sapkota criticized the government’s reversal of key policies established by the previous administration, particularly in areas of combating corruption, promoting good governance, and ensuring social justice. He said, “The previous government prioritized the fight against corruption and the promotion of good governance, prosperity, and social justice, but these efforts are being systematically undone.” He also pointed out that the issue of nationality is becoming more complex and that there are efforts to undermine democratic values and ideals. Sapkota added that the government is failing to meet the basic needs of the people. “This government will fall due to its own actions, but we must continue to guide the people toward change and progress,” he stated. Sapkota further accused the government of targeting competent individuals who are making positive contributions to the country. “It appears there is a deliberate effort to remove those who are doing good work,” he said, noting that the country is facing a “critical situation” that requires unity and cooperation among all political parties. He also criticized the focus on internal party divisions instead of a unified national approach. “The talk of constitutional amendments is simply a cover for their power grab. They used the idea of amendments to secure their own hold on power.” Sapkota accused the government of weakening political parties and complicating issues related to nationality. On the issue of constitutional amendments, he argued, “If the constitution is to be amended, it should be to promote progress, expand people’s rights, and strengthen democracy.” He also called for the introduction of a directly elected presidential system to address the current instability in the country, stating that this was the only way to achieve political stability. Additionally, he advocated for a fully proportional electoral system, where MPs would actively participate in policymaking, and experts would take on ministerial roles. “Under this government, the people’s interests are continually ignored,” Sapkota concluded. “The coalition between the first and second parties is raising concerns about the rise of authoritarianism and a potential slide into dictatorship.”"

Prachanda accuses govt of shielding corruption while targeting opposition,"ATHMANDU: Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda,” the Chairman of the Maoist Center and leader of the main opposition party, has accused the government of prioritizing its own interests while targeting rivals under the pretext of promoting good governance.

PM Oli’s actions confirm corruption allegations: Prachanda,"JUMLA: Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda,” chairman of the Maoist Center, has accused Prime Minister KP Oli of affirming that his government protects corruption by accepting land from an individual currently on trial.

Three months in, the evidence is evident,” he stated. Prachanda noted that under his leadership, the government returned land taken from a person arrested for this very action, which is still under legal review. “By permitting the land to be donated back to this businessman, the Prime Minister has confirmed that this government is protecting the corrupt.” He criticized the government’s inability to fulfill its responsibilities, announcing plans for a protest after the first 100 days of the government’s term. “Despite these shortcomings, we have held off on protests during this ‘honeymoon period,'” he said. Prachanda recalled his own leadership, highlighting his significant achievements in fighting corruption and striving for good governance, social justice, and economic growth. He expressed disappointment over being ousted by the first and second parties in parliament during a crucial phase of positive change. “When we were making crucial progress, especially in tackling corruption and issues related to the fake Bhutanese refugee scandal, a new government was hastily formed amid significant turmoil,” he explained. He stressed that during his tenure, he inspired hope among the people and improved Nepal’s international standing, citing landmark agreements made during visits to neighboring countries and attention received at global events like the UN General Assembly, World Food Conference, and COP 28."

50 percent of women candidatures in direct electoral system sought,"Joint General Secretary of the Nepali Congress, Mahalaxmi Upadhyay (Dina), has insisted on ensuring 50 percent of women candidacies in the direct electoral system, constitutionally. In her address to a daylong Bagmati Province-level orientation on ‘Equal Participation of Women in Electoral System: Current Issues and Guarantee of Women Representation’ here today, she said 50 percent participation of women in each State’s apparatus is not achievable only through the encouragement of women engagement in politics through the proportional electoral system. “The Nepali Congress has played a significant role in establishing women in politics. However, 50 percent participation of women in the party’s decision-making level has been a long wait. Dwarika Devi Thakurani, the first women minister in the entire South Asia was from the Nepali Congress.  Women contributed significantly to the 2006 people’s movement. Now time has come to ensure their 50 percent women’s candidatures from each party in the first-past-the-post electoral system,” she said. Despite contributing largely to each political movement in the country, the rights of women have not been adequately institutionalized as their presence in the decision-making levels is negligible, according to the leader. As she said, women’s rights to property and equal lineage have not been institutionalized under various structural and social circumstances. Stating that the first 2008 Constituent Assembly had 34 percent women’s participation, she said women’s political representation and access gradually fell due to the growing culture of an electoral alliance. Also speaking at the programme, Pushpa Bhusal, the NC central member, said women should unite to claim their stake in each level of the State, and women leaders should be ready to deliver in the best interests of the citizens. “One should be active in the party with people-friendly approach and goal. Then, capacity should be developed to be established in every social forum. Women’s leadership cannot be achieved only from the development of physical infrastructures. There will be no sufficient activities for the women’s representation until the issues of women’s economic equality and educational status are forwarded”, she shared. Likewise, lawmaker and NC central committee member Sarita Prasain viewed that constant struggle was needed to establish women’s representation. She mentioned, “There is no representation of women even in cabinet as guaranteed by the constitution and law. Struggle is still necessary for the women’s representation. Women should make themselves capable to establish in politics. An environment should be created"

In an interview he gave to RSS recently, the UML Chair said, “We are of the belief that democracy should be based healthy competition. We together drafted the Constitution and should move ahead together. The required outlet can be provided to the nation by moving forward hand-in-hand.” Asked about his thoughts on big parties including the Nepali Congress and the UML together leading the country for resolving the specific problems facing the nation, he recalled that the UML itself had proposed to the Congress for working together at the time of the Constitution promulgation, making it clear that they have never lagged behind when the Congress has come forward for dialogue. Stating that the UML does not steps back from the journey of dialogue and consensus on national issues, but rather takes the lead, the former PM stated, “In such situations, the UML had taken the lead and paved the way in a democratic manner in the past as well and it will not backtrack from it even now if required.” He said it should not be forgotten that after the devastating earthquake (in 2015) the UML had played a constructive role with the commitment to work together with the CPN (Maoist Centre) on reconstruction and constitution making, although it was the opposition party at that time. “We have a history of working for the country and the people also in the past. All should come together when necessary. The UML, Congress and Maoist Centre alone had worked together for the nation in the past,” Chairman Oli said, answering the question why not the three largest parties – the Nepali Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre- which are the agents of political change in Nepal, together form a coalition government for the purpose of giving political stability to the country in the context of the citizens yearning for the same at present. The UML Chair and former Prime Minister said, “The UML is a party that works in deference to the people’s aspirations and the nation’s need. Collaboration is needed among the agents of change for the country’s political stability. The UML is for taking the lead for this.” Saying constitution is the means of happiness and prosperity of the nation and people, Chair Oli mentioned, “Dialogue is the best tool to remove misunderstanding taking place among us. Dialogue can lead to consensus. Dialogue is again necessary. It is not necessary that there should be agreement on everything, but there must be consensus at least on basic things.  We brought multi-party system of healthy competition of ruling and the opposition. Consensus should be accepted without refusing this system. ” Responding to a query, he explained that they have no excuse not to provide any achievement to the people while remaining in the government. “To be in power is to develop the country and provide facilities to the people. There is no meaning to remain in the government if people’s problems are not addressed. There is no meaning of any government if it fails to address the people’s problems,” he underlined. Chair Oli explained that the UML proposed the Nepali Congress to join hands at a time when it is necessary to develop the system as envisaged by the Constitution and to formulate laws, adding the NC should be serious on it. “We should stand together and we are one on basic principles of democracy. We brought this system after long struggle and on our own choosing. It should be made strong. Constitution should be amended if problems surfaced in course of its implementation. We should hold dialogue and forge consensus for its successful implementation keeping the people at the centre,” he stressed."

Much has been done after establishment of republic: RSP Chief Whip Pariyar,"More than one and a half decades have already passed since the establishment of the republic by abolishing the 247-year-old monarchy from the country. Promulgation of the new constitution through the Constituent Assembly (CA) and the establishment of the republican system were great achievements for Nepal as they were the long-awaited political slogans in the country. However, political stability has not been maintained in the country yet. In the understanding of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) parliamentary party chief whip Santosh Pariyar, political stability is not concerned with picking an individual as the prime minister for a full five-year term but with stability in policy, principle and political ideology. “Stability should be in policy, philosophy, political ideology and understanding. A person remaining in the post of Prime Minister for five years does not mean stability.  Knowledge as per our system and capacity for the implementation is also necessary for the stability,” Pariyar underlined. Pariyar described the ongoing parliament disruption as the friction between the new and old political forces after the latter refused to provide space to the new forces. According to Pariyar, political transformation will not be sustainable and institutionalized until it ensures positive changes in the lives of the general public. After the establishment of the republic, we have come to a comparatively better status and this should be made further broad, he added. “We have achieved many things in quantity after the republic system but we are yet to ensure quality. It takes time to ensure delivery. Conceptually, we have made a significant change. Reaching a common citizen to the post of country’s executive head, constitutional boy’s chief and head of the state is not a minor achievement. We have failed to meet people’s expectations and the political parties should take responsibility for this condition but much has been done on education, health care, housing and other sectors,” Pariyar observed. The RSP Chief Whip admitted that we lack the knowledge to transfer our society and also we have limited capacity for practical implementation of our indigenous knowledge. “Mainly, I see a lack of seriousness on the part of political parties and their leaders. We failed to break the deep-rooted societal dogmas. We waged immense revolutions but they too kneeled before societal dogmas,” Pariyar shared hinting at patriarchy, caste-based discrimination and some religious ill-practices. During his interview with the RSS, Pariyar also expressed his doubts concerning the political parties’ trust towards the present constitution. Pariyar said, “Political parties are not taking ownership of this constitution. Some interest groups are taking advantage of it,” He also stressed that implementation of the constitution is the first priority but it could be amended to ensure a more progressive path after the implementation. Responding to a query about people’s expectations towards the RSP, Pariyar said the RSP could not carry out activities to address the people’s expectations in a short period and argued that new political forces should prevail for this. “The RSP can bring about changes in the country as per the people’s expectations if it leads the single-party government after the elections of 2084. The number of lawmakers in the parliament also matters a lot”, he mentioned. Stating that naturally old parties would be replaced by new ones, the RSP Chief Whip explained that the RSP could be made a better party by strengthening its organisaton, bringing clarity to ideas and continuously developing the party more ideologically. “We look the same as other parties in the parliament. But we are different if we are analyzed deeply,” he claimed, explaining that political stability would be established in the country if there is devotion and belief towards the political system, understanding of the society and priority of activities to be implemented. He stressed that there is harmony among the major and old parties on the issue of making government and sharing power, but they lack harmony in providing justice and working in favour of the people. “Many of our practices have become outdated. They should be redefined. People should remain safe along with getting an opportunity to live a comfortable and convenient life. The government should guarantee justice and social and economic security,” added RSP leader Pariyar."

Sodari of CPN (Unified Socialist) appointed Sudurpashim Chief Minister,"Sodari of CPN (Unified Socialist) appointed Sudurpashim Chief Minister Sudurpashim, April 18: Dirgha Bahadur Sodari of CPN (Unified Socialist) has been appointed the Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province. Province Chief Najir Miya appointed Sodari on the post on Thursday in accordance with Article 168 (2) of the Constitution.  Sodari is the parliamentary party leader of the CPN (US) in the Sudurpashim Province Assembly (PA). He secured the support of CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (UML), Nagarik Unmukti Party (not all but those believed to be in the camp of party Chair Ranjita Shrestha Chaudhary) and independent PA member Dr Tara Joshi to be eligible for the appointment to the CM post. Sodari had presented his claim for the appointment to the post on Thursday itself. On April 5, the Province Chief had called on political parties to stake their claim for the Chief Minister post by giving a time of ten days. Laxman Kishor Chaudhary and Kailash Chaudhary of the Nagarik Unmukti on April 14 presented their claims, seeking the appointment as the Chief Minister. Finding both claims unconvincing, the Province Chief on April 16 made a fresh call on political parties to approach him constitutionally for the appointment of the Chief Minister till Thursday (April 18). The division with the Nagarik Unmutki in the Province Assembly turned decisive in the formation of a new government under the leadership of the Unified Socialist having four members in the 53-member PA. However, the party’s PA member Ghanashyam Chaudhary who is said to be close to Resham Chaudhary faction met with the Province Chief on Thursday itself to express concern over the claim presented by Sodari. As Chaudhary told the Province Chief, the party had officially no support the CPN (US) for the Chief Minister. The intra-party conflict in the Nagariki Unmukti, the fourth largest party in the Sudurpashsim, shows no sign of normalcy. The Ranjita Shrestha faction is for following the suit of the central alliance while those close to the party founder Resham Lal Chaudhary are inclined towards siding with the Nepali Congress. In the 53-member PA, the NC is the largest one with 18 members followed by 10 of CPN (Maoist Centre) except the Speaker, seven of Nagarik Unmukti, four of Unified Socialist, one of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and one independent. The by-election for the vacant post (Bajhang-A) is taking place on coming April 27. The support of 27 PA members is mandated to be eligible for getting appointed the Chief Minister. —-"

Reforms needed to increase women’s participation in elections: Chief Election Commissioner,"Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya has said that the existing laws and social environment should be improved to increase the meaningful participation of women in elections. Speaking in the inaugural session of interaction on ‘Elections and Women: Efforts, Achievements and Future Action Plan of Nepal’, organized here today by the Election Commission and the UN Women in the context of International Women’s Day, Chief Commissioner Thapaliya expressed concern over the trend of giving women’s candidacy only in the positions considered binding by law and not ensuring the participation of women in the overall politics. Thapaliya said that although the number of the people’s representatives who won the last election of Nepal is higher than the Asian countries, it cannot absorb the spirit of proportional inclusiveness of Nepal’s constitution. “In our understanding, the ability of women in politics has been devalued. They have been deprived of rights and opportunities in a competitive way,” Thapaliya said. According to the Chief Election Commisisoner, overall, the environment for women’s participation in elections has not been created enthusiastically. There have also been instances of violence against women involved in politics through social media, he added. In order to improve all these situations, it seems that groups including the inter-party women’s network should facilitate more. At present, about 42 percent of women participate in the local level, 36 percent in the province level and 34 percent in the federal parliament. Similarly, Election Commissioner Dr Janaki Kumari Tuladhar stressed on the need to increase the number of women voters for the meaningful participation of women in the elections and informed that necessary facilitation is being done to increase the participation on behalf of the Commission. Ravilal Panth, secretary of the commission, said that as per Article 34 (4) of the Constitution of Nepal, representation should be based on the principle of proportional inclusion at all levels of the State, so the Commission is working to make the electoral system gender-friendly. Patricia Fernandez, the Country Representative of UN Women in Nepal, said that since the meaningful participation of women in politics is the basic qualification of democracy. Experts Gopal Krishna Sivakoti and Saru Joshi are scheduled to present suggestions on different areas in a group discussion sessions to ensure a strong participation of women in elections."

While sharing the decision of the meeting, chief whip Ramesh Lekhak said that this decision of the government is undemocratic and against the parliamentary values and practice. According to him, the Congress has criticized and condemned the government’s decision. “In the House, all the opposition parties have been raising the issue of misappropriation of the funds of the cooperatives. The minister in the government was involved in the misappropriation of the funds of the cooperatives, so they were demanding the formation of a parliamentary investigation committee to ensure a fair and independent investigation,” he said, adding that their demand has been ignored. “The ruling party is alleging that the House was blocked because of the opposition party. It is merely an allegation,” he said, adding that the Congress has been raising the issue of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the misappropriation of the cooperative’s funds with facts and evidence. Lekhak said that the government was not serious about it and the House was suspended for a few days, so the government itself should take responsibility for it. This meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party has committed to stand more firmly for an independent, fair and credible investigation on the matter of defrauding the funds of the cooperative, informed the chief whip.

Stating that the opposition parties have been making the problems seen in cooperative sector as a political issue rather than solving it after the change in the political alliance, PM Dahal underlined, “Earlier, the Nepali Congress was with us in the government. The issue of cooperative was minor for them that time. After exiting from the government, formation of a parliamentary probe committee has been demanded keeping Rabi Lamichhane in the centre. It is based on political prejudice.” He clarified that the efforts made to break the existing political equation would not be successful."

HoR session: NC continues to press for formation of parliamentary probe panel,"Major opposition Nepali Congress (NC) has continued to advocate for forming a parliamentary committee to probe into issues about cooperative mismanagement. Taking time in a meeting of the House of Representatives today, party General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma reiterated the party’s voice for forming the parliamentary panel to investigate the alleged connection of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the cooperative fraud. He utilized the forum to argue that the House is neither a venue for convicting anyone of any offense nor giving a clean chit on the charge. “Instead the matter should be addressed through a due process.” Lawmaker Sharma also expressed concern over what he said the ruling party declared the Minister innocent from the House. “The practice of declaring anyone guilty or innocent from a rostrum or a parliamentary floor is not good. If the Home Minister is not guilty, the right to be declared innocent by a parliamentary committee should be guaranteed.” He presented three reasons clarifying the need to form a parliamentary body to address the matter. “It is due to the realization of a conflict of interest, suspension of an official investigation into the cooperatives, and the issue requiring to be addressed by the parliamentary procedures.” The NC lawmaker wanted the government to bring a proposal to form the committee in the next lower house session. He warned that the party would take up the issue more seriously in the days ahead and it is committed to its stance (of forming a parliamentary probe committee). The ultimatum to the government for proceeding ahead with the constitution of the committee has been over, he said, hinting about the party’s preparations for further amplifying the programmes of protests over the matter. As he said, there is a misunderstanding at the civic level that the parliamentary proceedings have been halted due to the NC obstruction.  On March 31, parliament held discussions on the agreement related to the International Solar Alliance (ISA). The following day, a proposal to seek considerations on the power trade bill was presented and on April 2, the House endorsed the BIMSETC Charter. He said he wanted to inform all Nepali citizens at home and abroad that the House continues its business. Lawmaker Sharma said an atmosphere should be built for implementing a House calendar, making the House more systematic and accountable. Any matters that are at variance with the meeting agenda will be rejected by the party. He also protested the presentations of issues in the rostrum sans an agreement in the Parliamentary Business Advisory and Consultative Committees. Speaker Devraj Ghimire said the Constitution incorporates the provisions allowing time for the Prime Minister or a Minister to put views in the parliament if requested. It is our practice and tradition to grant time to the Prime Minister and Ministers to express views if demanded, he said."

A parliamentary probe committee should be formed in this connection.” He contended that a doubt has arisen regarding how justice can be done on this topic based on the Prime Minister’s replies in parliament and the Police Chief’s response on this topic in the parliamentary committee meeting. Stating that the main opposition party Nepali Congress is well aware of the fact that the parliament should not be held hostage over certain demands, he called upon the government also to be serious regarding its responsibilities. Lawmaker Gautam demanded that the parliament should also press the government to address the livelihood issues of the people. He reiterated that the main opposition party would continue raising this issue until the parliamentary investigation committee was formed. “The then Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha had responded in the parliament itself that an investigation was on in this connection. But, now the investigation is stopped,” he said, adding that appointing Lamichhane as the Home Minister is a conflict of interest.

New political equation prompted by party’s internal decision: Maoist Centre leader Bhusal,"CPN (Maoist Centre) Vice Chairperson Pampha Bhusal has said there is no external influence in the recent political developments within the nation. In an interview with RSS, the Vice Chair of the major ruling party stated that the shift in political dynamics, resulting from the party’s decision to break its alliance with the Nepali Congress and form a new coalition with CPN (UML) and other parties, was purely an internal decision of the party. “It is unimaginable to think about the role of external forces in such developments,” she argued when various political reactions are being heard in the political sphere over the latest political developments in the country. Each political event in Nepal is normally considered the outcome of foreign influence, and this is a misconception. The latest political development is totally the internal one.  And, the new alliance is expected to contribute to further consolidating the ties with close neighbors and the world community, according to her. Regarding concerns about potential political instability due to frequent changes in alliances, Bhusal described it a positive shift towards clearer political alignments and increased political sustainability. “It will guide the nation towards the direction of political stability by analyzing factors that led to the breakdown of the left alliance in the past.” In response to query whether the change would have its impact on the transitional justice issues, she said achieving peace is a collective responsibility of all political parties and the entire nation. She hoped that the inclusion of CPN (UML) in the government would expedite the resolution of transitional justice issues. Bhusal expressed confidence that ruling and opposition parties would collaborate to successfully conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process and ensure lasting peace in Nepal while strengthening democracy and progressing towards socialism. While responding to ‘criticisms’ about the party’s ‘inability’ to deliver efficiently to bring political stability in the country, she said such blame is due to a misunderstanding between mobility and instability. She asserted that the Maoist party remains the most dynamic force in the country, contributing to significant political transformations. Bhusal underscored the progressive nature of the political course and affirmed the role of Maoist leadership in driving these changes."

There is a strong organization in all the villages and communities of the country. “We have the highest number of people’s elected representatives at the federal, provincial and local levels in the last elections,” Deuba said.

"Lawmaker with RSS:

Once consensus eludes on transitional justice, due process beings: Ramesh Lekhak","Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramesh Lekhak has said if consensus eludes among political parties on transitional justice, due process would be followed to conclude it. Lekhak said he was devoted to law making since his first term of House of Representatives (HoR) membership. However, people are shared development agenda rather than law and policy making before election, he mentioned. He blamed that lawmakers are obsessed more on development of their constituencies than law making. He underscored the need of taking together law making and development agenda. Lekhak who is Chief Whip of Nepali Congress now shared that he was not able to give time to his constituency after becoming Chief Whip. He shared his views while talking to RSS reporter Sher Bahadur Singh for the ‘Lawmaker with RSS’ segment. According to him, parliament should make government accountable, while parliament should be accountable to people. But, present government has failed to make parliament active up to the mark. The NC Chief Whip admitted that he too had foibles to this end. “Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ has said he would be active to give business to the parliament. Let’s see how the running parliament delivers,” he stated. Lekhak expressed worry over protracted law making to address transitional justice (TJ). The TJ bill to amend the previous Act has been pending in the parliament for long. It has been 17 years the TJ is in surface. But, we’re entangled in it and yet to sort it out. Although the TJ Act was brought nine years back, the Supreme Court ruled against some provisions in it, rendering the Act ineffective. The commissions on TJ are also non-functional. We’ve been making efforts for consensus, but it is still elusive. If the consensus eludes again, due process would be adopted, he explained. As he informed, the ruling coalition held talks with major opposition CPN UML in this connection, but they had differing views. The NC Chief Whip also talked about geographical difficulty of Sudurpaschim Province. He shared that it is not only distant from federal capital, Kathmandu, but also allocated limited budget, thereby facing development confines. Economic and educational indicators need improvement here, he suggested. Constituency no 3 of Kanchanpur district has huge potential, but we have not been able to identify and unlock. The important places as of economic corridors and tourist destinations of India and China are not far from here. Not only this district but entire Nepal can be benefitted from these places after establishing strong links. “I’ve been raising the issue of trilateral border since my political career to reap benefit and boost national economy. In this vein, we stressed construction of dry port at Dodhara Chandani. An agreement has been made with India for the detailed project report (DPR) for it. Similarly, a four-line motorable bridge over the Mahakali River is being completed soon. The Mahakali corridor to link China is also speeded up,” he informed. Lekhak is a HoR member elected from constituency no 3 of Kanchanpur district representing the Nepali Congress through the general election, 2079. He is in NC politics for long."

RSS with lawmaker: Karki insists on swift progress on lately introduced bills,"As the existing parliament approaches its one-year anniversary since its establishment, Ganga Karki, representing the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the House of Representatives (HoR), reflects on the crucial legislative responsibilities of a lawmaker: the enactment of laws. However, his evaluation is that the much-needed laws mandated by the Constitution of the federal democratic republic of Nepal are still awaited, impeding the effective implementation of the country’s main law. Likewise, the lawmaker from Dolakha believes that that political parties’ focus on serving the partisan and individual interests has its implications on the operation of the House. “But again, the latest development is not disappointing. Parliamentary procedures are well-defined, and the passage of any law follows a set process. Although the House has fallen short of meeting the people’s expectations for legislation, recent times have seen the presentations of various bills in parliament, and they should be expedited for resolution.” He is dissatisfied with the ‘mindset’ to establish a notion that the federal democratic system is merely the continuity of the previous parliamentary system. As he said, such mindset is an obstruction to serve the interest of the federal democratic republic system. The 60-year-old lawmaker had joined the leftist movement when he was still a minor. He has also the experiences of taking charge of a brigadier commissar during the ‘people’s war’. The lawmaker evaluates that an absence of a single majority in the House has hindered the implementation of party election manifestos. The coalition government, led by the third-largest party in parliament, has had to consider the sentiments of coalition partners in every parliamentary move. However, the recent pace of bill presentations in the House is deemed satisfactory, according to him. As he said, several bills, including those aimed at preventing loan sharking, relating to citizenship, land, education, anti-money laundering, and energy, have been introduced in parliament. This progress could not go unnoticed amidst the presence of a coalition government, even though expectations have not been fully met. According to him, frequent house obstructions over different matters have impacted the preparations of bills. He said those who are against a federal democratic republic system are unnecessarily protesting both in the House and on the streets. “The mindset to reverse the achievements is concerning. Some faces are publicly correct and support a progressive system in the nation, but in reality, they oppose the concepts of a republic, secularism, proportional inclusion, hindering the nation’s path to progress,” the lawmaker adds."

RSS Lawmaker: Govt. Must Be Responsible,"Nepali Congress leader and member of House of Representatives,Dilli Raj Panta, has argued that the government has not been able to carry out activities as per the people’s expectations as it has been more responsible towards its party, leaders and cadres. Lawmaker Panta said, “All political leaders should focus their attention on the welfare of the nation and making the country prosperous being raised above partisan interest.” Talking with RSS, Panta of the Nepali Congress, elected to HoR from Kailali constituency-5 expressed the view that all political parties should be united to bring the guilty under the ambit of law after carrying out investigation on recent corruption and irregularities cases in the country. Saying the incumbent government is looking like a government of the party rather than of the people and it has become failure to carry out effective activities, lawmaker Panta suggested the government to work in favour of the people and positive message could be disseminated among the people towards parties, leaders and cadres if the government becomes accountable towards the people. He further said ministers are remaining silent on the issues raised in the parliament after the government is found more accountable towards its party, leaders and cadres rather than the people. Expressing dissatisfaction with theSupreme Court‘s decision of banning the implementation of Constituency Development Fund, the lawmaker commented that it has curtailed the legislative right and added that it was against the state’s principle of separation of powers. The first priority of the lawmakers is to formulate laws, he stressed. Born in 2012 BS in Kailali district, Panta had started political career from Nepal Student Union in 2030 and later joined the active politics of the Nepali Congress. He passed his SLC exam from jail. During the 1990s people’s movement, Pant remained underground and was actively involved in rural areas. Despite his continuous engagement inNepali Congresspolitics since then, he has never pursued party posts. He played an active role in the 2062-63 BS (2006) second people’s movement and was initially elected to the Sudur Paschim Province Assembly from the Kailali constituency-5 (B) during the 2017 elections. Currently, he serves as a representative for the party’s general convention. In response to a query about the House’s performance and its legislative role, he acknowledged that the House has been lacking sufficient business to meet expectations. The House appears to be more focused on zero and special hours. In addition to this, opposition parties frequently obstruct House proceedings on various issues, which has overall impeded the House’s essential functions. Furthermore, it has failed to effectively address the daily lives and contemporary issues of the people, according to the lawmaker He believes that representatives should participate in House proceedings in a respectful and disciplined manner. Similarly, he said it is also wrong to demand unarchiving of any statement that fails to serve the interest of any particular party from theparliamentaryrecordings, adding that such practice is capable of infringing on the people’s right to freedom of expression. His assessment is that there have been no significant improvements in people’s lives even after the 1990s movement, highlighting the need to address the situation. In the past, Nepal used to be a food exporter, but now it heavily depends on food imports. “It needs collective efforts to advance toward achieving the goal of prosperity.” —"

Lawmakers Compelled to Focus on Development,"Member of Parliament (MP) and Whip of the Nepali Congress parliamentary partySushila Thinghas shared that the dual responsibilities of lawmaking and carrying out development works have added to the sufferings of the lawmakers. Talking to the RSS for ‘RSS with Lawmaker, the NC MP said, “Getting focused on development issues is not our interest, it is a compulsion”. She argued that allegations labelled against the lawmakers for their engagements on development works is unfair though their key priority should be on lawmaking. HoR Member Thing added that failure to participate in the country’s development discourse will result in the wrong impression for the lawmakers since they ‘seek conditional vote for development construction in the time of elections’. She states that a broad initiative and effort of political parties, government and civil society is needed to make people understand the problems of the lawmakers and institutionalize the enabling system in the state. “The lawmakers are in trouble due to the distressing circumstance where the people’s even a single demand is not addressed,” according to MP Thing. Starting her political journey in 2047 BS, Thing was elected the HoR Member in 2079 BS. Prior to this, she was the deputy-mayor of Kamalamai Municipality in Sindhuli. Sharing her 10-month-long experiences in the HoR, Thing said she is firm on discharging her duty as a goodparliamentarianby contributing in making good laws. She shared that the priorities and targets of the House have affected due to a divided mentality among the political parties and for being a hung Parliament. Stating that the parliament spent some time for the elections of the President, Vice President and Prime Minister, MP Thing shared there has been some delay in lawmaking due to different reasons but it is not true that nothing has happened. Thing told the RSS that the intentions of particular political parties are more wrong than the policies for the successful operation of the parliamentary system. She viewed that separate interpretation of a same political party from the ruling and opposition bench is a wrong trend. She also pointed out the need for deep study of the lawmakers on several issues including the laws, parliamentary regulations, constitution and others. On parliamentary development funds, MP Thing said that the verdict of the Supreme Court should be taken into consideration though it brings about good results after its meaningful use since there was evidence of misappropriations in the past. “The voters have sent the lawmakers for thelawmakingprocess. So, the government should also make arrangements for the entire focus of the MPs for this issue,” MP Thing concludes."

"Lawmakers incompetent to deliver, argues Chairman KC","“The harrowing fact at present is: major political parties’ character and behaviour have caused disappointment and discontent among people towards the loktantra and republic which we got with hard struggles.” It is what Chairman ofRastriya Janamorcha, Chitra Bahadur KC, asserts. He blames incompetence of lawmakers behind delayed and slack implementation of constitution and federalism. The nature and activities of the major political parties have prompted people to seek alternatives, according to KC. A mature politician, KC expressed worry, “One year passed since the general election, but a single Act is not formulated. How shameful it is for us to show face to the people, to the voters!” It is not the incompetence of parliament, but of parliamentarians, he reminded. KC further said parliamentarians are bound to escape their visibility from voters by hiding in the city. Talking to Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS), Chairman KC viewed lawmakers’ major responsibility is to make law and policies, and amend the laws as per relevance and timeliness. However, voters regard lawmakers also as the persons responsible fordevelopment works, he added. According to him, it is ironic that the lawmakers run from pillars to post- from ministers’ chambers to employees’ rooms demanding ‘development’ instead of getting busy in parliament to debate bills and regulation and prepare Acts. Also the former Minister for Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, KC said the voters demand taps, road, school building, canal, and embankment on the other hand. It has shadowed the duty and responsibility of lawmakers. “Voters demand gabion wire to control landslip in terraces. It is our weakness that we are unable to convince them about our role and responsibility as lawmakers,” KC shared, adding that rather than meeting local and province representatives, they directly call and complain to federal lawmakers. He however admits it is right on the part of people because lawmakers promise much to voters before election. Chairman KC argues that elections were becoming costly because of parliamentary development funds. “If thepolitical leadersand lawmakers had carried out development and policies in a right manner, Nepal would not have faced such an exodus of youths for foreign jobs. We have the nature of talking much and delivering little. We need correction,” KC emphasized. He also vehemently criticizes lawmakers’ role on forming and breaking alliances and conspiring to topple the government for partisan interest. It is proved with the fact that it took seven months and more to prepare the regulations of parliamentary committees which had to be prepared within 15 days."
‘NC should take lead to resolve issues in practical implementation of constitution’,"Acting Prime Minister and Nepali Congress (NC),Vice-President Purna Bahadur Khadkasaid that NC should take the lead to troubleshoot the practical implications that surface in implementation of the constitution.

Sharma argued that the recent issue of giving amnesty to the culprits has received several criticisms towards the President and added that the people are frustrated as the President as an institution was criticized due to wrongdoings of the government. —"
"JSP implements new party statute, reshuffling committees","TheJanata Samajbadi Party (JSP)Nepal has implemented its new party statute. Implementing the statute, the party is in the process of significantly reshuffling the party committees at all levels, from the central to the local level.

CM Karki viewed it while inaugurating the first convention of Progressive and Professional Legal Practitioners’ Association close to his party here Saturday. “The UML had to make strong stand on naming Khoshi Province, but it was not so,” he admitted, expressing worry that some of UML cadres themselves wrote and opined against naming of Koshi Province. He asserted that the naming Province-1 as Koshi Province was correct and there was no point in getting backtracked from it. According to him, a protest was launched forcefully against naming the province. He further argued that the protest was not raised from local people but outsourced by bringing people even from the federal capital, Kathmandu. CM Karki also blamed that some elements were trying to launch communal riot here.

Pakistan poll body says elections to be held in last week of January,"TheElection Commission of Pakistanon Thursday announced that the elections will take place next year in January, according to Dawn. Notably, the elections will be held in the last week of January, according to the poll body. The ECP stated in a statement that it had examined the apportionment of seats, Dawn reported. The preliminary list of constituencies will be published on September 27, 2023, according to the decision made by the ECP on Thursday after reviewing the delimitation process’s development. The final list of constituencies will be released on November 30 after complaints and comments regarding the preliminary lists have been heard, according to several media reports in Pakistan. The election will then be scheduled for a 54-day period, with voting taking place in the final week of January 2024. Earlier, in August, Pakistan President Arif Alvi invitedChief Election Commissioner(CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja for a meeting to “fix an appropriate date” for general elections. In his letter to the Chief Election Commissioner, Alvi referred to Article 244 of the Constitution and said that he was duty-bound to get the elections conducted within the prescribed 90-day period after Pakistan’s National Assembly was dissolved prematurely. However, a recent amendment to the Elections Act 2017 allowed the ECP to announce the dates for elections unilaterally without having to consult the president. After the dissolution of the National Assembly of Pakistan in August, Senator Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar was picked as caretaker Prime Minister of the country. Commenting on the upcoming general elections, PM Kakar earlier said that he hopes that the ECP would thoroughly look into the matter of holding free and fair polls as per the Constitution. Meanwhile expressing his views on the prerogative to announce the election date, the interim prime minister put his weight behind the ECP. “The president has announced the polls date, whereas it is in fact the ECP’s prerogative”.

Governance weaknesses can be overcome by political righteousness: President Paudel,"President Ramchandra Paudelhas said the governance weaknesses are to be overcome by our political righteousness and it is necessary for us to make democracy result-oriented by establishing its sanctity. At a programme organised at Sheetal Niwas on Wednesday on the occasion of Constitution Day and National Day, 2080, President Paudel said, “We must remain watchful to make sure that the achievements of people’s movements are not again weakened from any quarter. We should remain alert to ensure that the provisions of democratic constitution are not subverted from anywhere.” He mentioned that the present Constitution has not only ended all kinds of discrimination and inequalities nurtured under authoritarian, centralized and unitary state systems but has also made Nepali people sovereign of state power in a real sense. “Our constitution, while stipulating federal democratic republic has not only envisaged political, economic, social, religious andcultural freedomsbut also justice to the helpless and income to the indigent,” President Paudel said, “The diverse range of rights, provisioned in the constitution are aimed at providing unhindered freedom to the destitute people while giving them opportunities to uplift their life standards.” Politically, the country has attained ‘republic’, the highest level of achievement that people aspired for a long time but the true meaning of the republic remains to be understood and internalized, he viewed, adding it still remains for us to properly understand that the republic is the system that not only ensures people’s direct participation but also accepts people to transform their conduct in accordance with spirit of the system. The President viewed that there is an ample possibility of making the country a distinct nation with Nepali ingenuity and as the world’s one of the advanced nations and have an important opportunity before the people. But this is possible only if we all work relentlessly to bring about drastic and righteous changes in our conduct and character in consonance with the democratic culture. There is no alternative to moving ahead protecting the Constitution and safeguarding the political achievements, he shared. “Our culture and nature have opened for us the door of infinite possibility to generate employment and income in the country. If we could properly harness the energy sector, modernize the agricultural realm and expand tourism domain, of course by ensuring good governance and ending all kinds of mismanagement, Nepal can easily reach the category of the world’s one of the advanced nations”, said the President. The President said the country has been hit by natural disasters triggered by climate change for the past several years, pointing out the need to move ahead in a concrete manner with the international community for addressing the challenges posed by the climate crisis. He also paid heartfelt tributes to martyrs who sacrificed their valuable lives for the establishment of democratic republic in Nepal, expressing sincere gratitude to the democratic fighters who endured imprisonment and also exile duringdemocratic movementsand remained unwaveringly active in favour of the political transformation in the country. Present on the occasion were Vice-President Ramsahaya Prasad Yadav, Acting Prime Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka, Chief Justice Bishwombhar Shrestha, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Chairperson of CPN (Unified Socialist) Madhav Kumar Nepal, former Chairperson of Council of Minister, Khilraj Regmi, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, ministers, former lawmakers, high-ranking officials of government, heads and representatives of diplomatic missions in Nepal, media persons as well as other personalities."
Non-Implementation of Fundamental Rights,"Former SpeakerDaman Nath Dhunganahas said non-implementation of fundamental rights reflect weaknesses of current ruling parties. During a programme organized as part of the BPLiterature Festivalat NC central office on Wednesday, former Speaker Dhungana said provisioning such many fundamental rights- 31- on the one hand and showing reluctance to implement these is contradictory. He further viewed, “Currentconstitutionis dominated by the Maoist party.  If not, why to give him frequent leadership? The constitution is not functional.” Similarly, Constituent Assembly member and former minister Nilambar Acharya said it was worrying that the laws required within three years of constitution for its implementation were not made yet. “If thedemocracyis to be strengthened as per BP’s thoughts, economic progress is imperative,” he underscored, adding that such exodus of Nepali youths reflects aggression towards political leadership. On the occasion, Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, however, claimed that NC brought Maoist party under its agenda during promulgation of constitution. —–"
Decent and peaceful approach earns repute: lawmaker Yadav,"House of Representativesmember elected from Saptari constituency no 3, Dinesh Kumar Yadav, views once the lawmakers regularly attend HoR meeting, the issue of quorum would not surface. Although the country held general elections two times after the promulgation of the new constitution, parliamentary practice is still poor in Nepal in Yadav’s observation. “Lawmakers must attend the meetings of parliament and parliamentary committees on time and discuss issues of public concern and debate on bills. But, all do not seem engrossed in it,” he commented, urging all lawmakers to be aware of pressing issues and participate in discussion actively. Yadav who entered politics by joiningNepal Students’ Unionin 2036BS continued his political career and progress- worked in various capacities as district president of Union and party, and a central member of the party from 2037 to 2052BS. During a dialogue with RSS, lawmaker Yadav viewed the HoR members need to be aware of the rights and responsibilities. According to him, proper study on the bills is necessary for right analyses and debate. Similarly, he is of the view that decency and peaceful manners count much to avoid impulse and frustration in the parliament. Nepal could learn from the international practices of parliament to strengthen the new system. Impulsive and aggressive thoughts have sometimes gone beyond parliamentary norm and decorum, he reminds. He also admitted that cooperation and coexistence lacked much among the three tiers of government although the country adopted federalism. “Although it was challenging to reach Singha Durbar to villages in the beginning, it finally reached. However, coordination among three layers of government is not up to the mark. It is a threat to federalism indeed.” Recalling people’s support to the political parties for such sweeping change in the country, he underscored the need of ensuring employment to youths, and irrigation and fertilizers to the farmers. The brain drain must be ended, he said, and observed that the country had however witnessed comparative progress. “Although exodus of youths earns foreign remittance, creation of jobs within home is the sustainable salutation,” he underscored. Lawmaker Yadav also described the plight of farmers in Tarai/Madhes which is called a granary of the country. Farmers’ problems must be addressed on time. In his observation, people are disappointed over the protracted formulation of laws to implement the constitution. The ruling parties and opposition haggling unnecessarily andobstructing parliamenttime and again has made people despair, he asserted. Moreover, uncertainty over the conduct of parliament has hindered lawmakers from reaching the doorsteps of voters, while there is not adequate time to debate the bills."
Role of the MP is being ‘paralyzed’: MP Pariyar,"Member of ParliamentSantosh Pariyarsays that a member of parliament is powerful while parliament forms as well as supervises the government. But since MPs are within the limits of the party there is little work that MPs can do on their own. In a dialogue with RSS, Pariyar, who is the chief whip of theRastriya Swatantra Party, said that even within the party the issue of ‘paralyzing’ MPs in a parliamentary system has been raised. “There is a need for a debate on this matter, if we can create a new thought or reach an understanding on it then the parliament will be very effective.” Pariyar, who became a federal parliamentarian following his background as a writer, reader, teacher and civil activist, does not see a clear role of a parliamentarian. He admits that the MPs get confused in roles other than the role of a lawmaker because they are directly connected with the development and problems of their constituencies. Due to this dual role of MPs, the law making process has not been effective. “Even though the constitutional and law say that the main role of MPs is legislative. But in our political practice, the role of thelegislatureis also connected with other development works”, he said. On a question about efficiency of the parliament which has passed only two bills in nine months, he said as an MP, he should take the responsibility that falls on him but the main responsibility belongs to the government and the coalition parties that run the government. “The parliamentarians are holding discussions and participating in the committees on the bills that are on the table in the parliament.” Furthermore, the parliament is authorized to oversee the government, raise the pressing problems of the country. While doing so, there may be differences of opinion between the ruling party and the opposition parties. In that sense, having a debate and discussion becomes a natural parliamentary exercise, but it should not go beyond the political culture. MP Pariyar also emphasized that theparliamentariansshould prepare themselves to take up issues that are not taken up by the government through a private bill. According to him, a successful legislature is to be able to take people’s issues to the parliament, establish them, inform them and draw attention towards them. He said that it is necessary to adopt the practice introducing necessary bills for social transformation through private bills. –––"

Rise above party thought to build the nation: MP Tamang,"Nepali Congress leader and member of the House of RepresentativesPurna Bahadur Tamanghas said that all political leaders should rise above their respective party notions to start building the nation. Elected as a member of the House of Representatives from Ramechhap, Tamang said that not only those in the government and political parties but all the MPs have not been able to focus on the rights and interests of the people and for the prosperity of the country. Tamang, who is also NC Ramechhap chairman, said in a dialogue with RSS, “All the leaders talk about building the nation but there is no national consensus among them on this matter and hence it does not get implemented in practice.” All parties should unite to investigate the truth about corruption and irregularities including the gold smuggling case,fake Bhutanese refugees, Lalita residence land case and bring the culprits involved in it to justice. MP Tamang expressed his displeasure that some leaders were not investigated in some cases of corruption and said if corruption is to be checked strict and fair action is necessary. On a different note, Tamang expressed his displeasure with the Supreme Court’s suspension of the implementation of the MP Development Fund programme, commenting that it was a curtailment of legislative powers. Born in Ramechhap in 2022 BS, Tamang entered politics in 2036 and after 2046 remained active in politics under the Congress party. Leader Tamang was elected district president of Ramechhap in the 14th general convention of the party. Referring to the fact that MPs are not getting business as required and laws are not being formulated as per the people’s expectations, MP Tamang claimed that the government is currently a coalition government consisting of various parties and the opposition parties also obstructed the House. Tamang said people’s representatives should participate in the discussions in the federal parliament in a disciplined and restrained manner. Since MPs are not only representatives of the people but also lawmakers, they should be able to convey a positive message through their presentation and conduct in the House, which will be recorded as history. He said it is time to think seriously about the public comments about the increase in administrative expenses including salary and other perks provided to people’s representatives in federalism. It has started to raise questions about thejustification of federalism."
People’s representatives should work to elevate parliament’s image: Lawmaker Chaudhary,"House of Representatives (HoR) member Ram Prakash Chaudhary has expressed displeasure on clash of interests among the political parties towards realizing the shared goal of successful implementation offederal democratic republic system. Recalling the former Speaker Subas Chandra Nembang’s expression and stance against holding hostage the parliament and his role in the parliament, Chaudhary said, “Various questions have been raised in regard to our failure to play an appropriate role in the parliament”. Chaudhary, a parliamentarian from the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, further stressed the need for the Members of Parliament to impart a positive message through deliberations and conduct, knowing their crucial role for law-making. “The people’s representatives should play the role to make the parliament a dignified institution”, he noted. Chaudhary who had entered into politics fromNepal Student’s Union(NSU) also had a 30-years’ experience in police service of Nepal. He commented that questions have been raised on parliamentary performance when only one bill related to loan-sharking was enacted in seven months of parliamentary operation after the general election. Chaudhary, a MP from Sarlahi constituency-1, is now the chief whip of Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP). He further shared that the prioritized and much-awaited bills such as federal civil service and education are in pipeline for parliamentary deliberations. The role of parliament and parliamentarians was visible and parliamentary proceedings took strides when the government provided business to the House, he said, adding they however had been raising the issues related to livelihood in the parliament. In a ‘Parliament with RSS’, lawmaker Chaudhary viewed giving less priority to the parliamentary or committee meetings as an act to undermine the parliamentary system and people’s verdict. “The parliament has a paramount importance. Our main job is to provide adequate time to the parliament and its committees’ works”, he said, adding it was obvious to manage the budget through theConstituency Development Fundfor development works. He commented this was the only programme through which equal budgetary allocations were made in electoral constituencies. He stressed the need to carry out fair investigations into the mega graft cases and book the guilty parties to impart a good message to the people."

Lawmakers fundamentally responsible for legislative duties: Ranju Kumari Jha,"Ranju Kumari Jha, a member of theHouse of Representativesfrom the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, firmly believes that the primary duty of lawmakers is to engage in formulation of laws, rather than being solely focused on development endeavors. Talking to RSS, the lawmaker stressed that lawmakers should dedicate adequate time for policy discussions and the enactment of laws. She called for close cooperation between the government, parliament and parliamentary committees to achieve the desired results. According to Jha, although the House is primarily responsible for formulations of policies and laws, this aspect is often sidelined in practice. During election campaigns, candidates often promise voters that they will accelerate development in their respective electoral constituencies and bring more and more budget for them in a bid to take them into confidence and win the elections. “First and foremost, it should be clear that lawmakers are not direct development actors, they are legislators, instead,” she said. She echoed the need for the effective role of lawmakers within the parliament before the presentation of any bill, during the formulation of the budget, and other policy-making procedures. As she assessed, the government has not provided sufficient business for the parliament, and the House has become a venue for making accusations and counter-accusations, which undermines its effective functioning. Jha believed that obstructing the House goes against the rules and the spirit of thedemocratic movement. She was of the opinion that the House should be properly utilized to amplify the voices of the people and promote dialogue among lawmakers, with experienced and senior members taking the lead. Furthermore, she stressed that any member in the House should analyze issues thoroughly before making hasty remarks. Regarding the revival of the Member of Parliament Development Fund in the form of the Parliamentary Constituency Infrastructure Development Programme and its relevance, Jha said that she is unaware of the reason behind its restoration. “However, it falls within the jurisdiction of the parliament and should not be subject to court intervention.” She also called for the inclusion of lawmakers from proportional representation, especially considering that the majority of women lawmakers belong to this group if this programme is implemented. The lawmaker urgedpolitical partiesand leaders to demonstrate honesty and integrity to create an atmosphere conducive to enforce the constitution effectively, adding that politics should be improved first to see improvements in other areas."
Adhere to BP’s thoughts to strengthen party: Leader Koirala,"Nepali Congress leaderDr Shekhar Koiralasuggested the party and government to adhere to BP’s thoughts so that they would be strengthened. He argued that arrogance in leadership was eroding party credibility. Leader Dr Koirala made such an observation during a conference organized by the BP Study Youth Circle here Wednesday.

Bernardo Arévalo wins Guatemala’s presidential election,"Bernardo Arévalo, progressive Movimiento Semilla party candidate appeared to have won Guatemala’s presidential election on Sunday (local time), CNN reported. With over 95 per cent of the ballots counted, Arévalo received 59.1 per cent of the votes beating former first lady Sandra Torres in a race where she garnered 36.1 per cent, according to official data from the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. It marks a stunning win for the former diplomat who reinvigorated a race that has been plagued by controversy after the state disqualified opposition candidates who spoke out against corruption – drawing concerns from rights groups and Western allies. The president of the electoral tribunal, Irma Palencia, said during a press conference on Sunday night that “today, the people voice’s spoke,” as it became apparent that Arévalo had won by a large margin, as per CNN. In a post on X, formally known as Twitter, Arévalo wrote: “Long live Guatemala!” Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei congratulated Arévalo for his win in a post on X, saying he would “extend the invitation to start the ordered transition the day after the results are official.” In the first round of voting in June, Torres received 16 per cent of the vote, while Arévalo received 11.8 per cent. However, more than 24 per cent of voters cast blank or invalid ballots, and about 40 per cent of eligible voters stayed home, which analysts have attributed to high levels of dissatisfaction with Guatemala’s electoral system after the state disqualified opposition candidates who spoke out against corruption, according to CNN. Guatemala watchers are cautiously hopeful that the popular will might prevail. Rights groups say graft and impunity accelerated among the country’s political class after a United Nations-backed anti-corruption commission, known as CICIG, credited for assisting in hundreds of convictions, was dissolved in 2019, CNN reported. Prosecutors and judges associated with the commission were arrested, investigated, and many have been forced to flee the country in the ensuing years amid high rates ofpovertyand malnutrition. (ANI)"
